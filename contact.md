I'm most easily reached by [email](mailto:kycuonghuynh@ucla.edu),
encrypted using my [PGP key](/PGP.txt) if needed. My key's full
fingerprint is: 

```
49C0 32E0 6BD9 71B5 B4A0  DFE1 F6EA A503 A921 7457
```

Its short key ID (which is [not enough by itself](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/74009/what-is-an-openpgp-key-id-collision) for verification)
is `A9217457`. The key itself is a [4096-bit](https://xkcd.com/538/) 
[RSA](https://xkcd.com/343/) key. 

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KyCodeHuynh).
Should anything ever go wrong (e.g., a compromised GitHub or Twitter
account), look to my [back-up Twitter](https://twitter.com/KyCuongPublic) for notices.
