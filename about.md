I'm Ky-Cuong, a 4th year computer science student at UCLA and a
software engineering intern with [AppFolio](http://www.appfolioinc.com/).
My current interest is full-stack web development, where I have experience in
Ruby on Rails, and a JavaScript stack with the Daily Bruin. Before that, I
programmed the Arduino-based electronics payload for UCLA Rocket Project and
handled the mass-deployment of hundreds of Macs and iPads for the UCLA Lab
School.

Outside of work, I enjoy paying it forward as an ACM Hack officer. This fall, I will lead Hack School, a quarter-long bootcamp in full-stack JavaScript. I'll also continue to organize capture the flag (CTF) competitions to train people in computer security. To relax, I can usually be found running with Bruinrunners or discussing the latest Sherlock episode.
