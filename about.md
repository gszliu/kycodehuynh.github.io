I'm Ky-Cuong, a 4th year computer science student at 
[UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/) and a
software engineering intern with [AppFolio](http://www.appfolioinc.com/).
My current interest is full-stack web development, where I have experience in
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and a JavaScript stack with 
the [Daily Bruin](http://dailybruin.com/). Before that, I
programmed the Arduino-based electronics payload for UCLA Rocket Project and
handled the mass-deployment of hundreds of Macs and iPads for the 
[UCLA Lab School](http://www.labschool.ucla.edu/).

Outside of work, I enjoy paying it forward as an ACM Hack officer. This fall, I will lead Hack School, a quarter-long bootcamp in full-stack JavaScript. I'll also continue to organize [capture the flag (CTF)](https://github.com/EaterOA/lug-acm-ctf-sp2016) competitions to train people in computer security. To relax, I can usually be found running with
[Bruinrunners](https://www.facebook.com/Bruinrunners) or discussing 
the latest Sherlock episode.
