title: Hello World!
---

Hi there!  

I'm Ky-Cuong, a computer science (CS) major at UCLA
who works as a web developer at Daily Bruin Online. 

Beyond that, I'm an aspiring full-stack software engineer, runner, and 
vegetarian. I believe strongly in the power of technology and education
to transform the world for the better. At the same time, I'm wary of how 
technology can be misused by the greedy and power-hungry, and am constantly
vigilant on this front. 

I have more thoughts to come. Stay tuned!
