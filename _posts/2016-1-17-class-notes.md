Hello all! 

I finally had time to generate a table of contents
for all of my posted class notes. I used the 
[MarkdownTOC](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownTOC) 
package for Sublime Text. The resulting TOCs are not perfect
and I'm sorry that the automatic linking did not work. For now, 
the best way to navigate these notes is to find the topic of 
interest, and then search for it with with a regular 
<kbd>Command+F</kbd> (OS X) or <kbd>Control+F</kbd> (Linux
and Windows). 

My plan is to add a scrollspy to them in the future, 
similar to what Bootstrap uses for its [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/css/).
