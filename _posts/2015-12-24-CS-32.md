title: CS 32 Notes
---

Below are my notes from CS 32 during the Winter 2014
quarter at UCLA. I hope that current CS 32 students
find them useful. I also highly recommend the notes
and practice problems by [Andrew Forney](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~forns/classes/winter-2014/cs-32/cs-32.html), one of the best CS TAs at UCLA. 

To read the notes offline:

* [Markdown version](https://ucla.box.com/s/avfnz8cwsyhgaajhk8x6eojdxw8p7gvq), best read in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), with the [MarkdownEditing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing)
package installed. 

* [PDF version](https://ucla.box.com/s/hlutu0sewz1dvcae3tpc7i3iwddwm0vq)

[Open a pull request](https://github.com/KyCodeHuynh/kycodehuynh.github.io/compare) if you find any 
errors, and I'll gladly correct them. 

Happy studying!

<p>// No PhD in anything. Adjunct professor. 
// Don't call unless arranged ahead of time. </p>

<p>// Email TA first, and combine questions into
// one email for Carey</p>

<p>// He goes to work after this class. Awesome!
// He volunteers to teach. </p>

<p>// Prize tickets for a raffle at the end 
// of class. </p>

<p>// Ice cream at last class if we beat Smallberg's
// section at the midterms</p>

<p>// No in-person appointments outside of OH
// because of his job. </p>

<p>// He says okay a lot</p>

<p>// Picked a number between 1-60. Carey figured it: 34
// He just flashed numbers in boxes and did it!</p>

<p>Carey is an alumn of '95. He was a departmental scholar,
graduating in 5.5 years with BS and MS.</p>

<p>// Made the people who came in late say something
// embarrassing about themselves.</p>

<p>// He finished a novel, but is looking for an agent</p>

<p>Check the website often for homework, as well as 
the PowerPoints. Click on Lecture 1 link. </p>

<p>What we'll learn: </p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced C++</li>
<li>Data structures</li>
<li>Major algorithms</li>
<li>Larger programs</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll know most of what we need for industry. 
The technical interview questions will draw 
from material covered in CS32 material. </p>

<p>Midterm 1: Wed, Janurary 29th</p>

<p>Midterm 2: Wed, Feburary 19th</p>

<p>Final: March 15th, 11:30 am - 2:30 pm  </p>

<p>Project 1 will determine if we're ready
for CS 32. A lot of work: 20-60 hours/week. </p>

<p>As before, all projects must compile
under Visual C++ and clang/gcc. </p>

            return false;
    }

    return true; 
}               
</code></pre>

<p>On our exams, we'll have problems harder

<h3>
<a id="user-content-algorithms" class="anchor" href="#algorithms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithms</h3>

<p>Algorithms are a set of instructions/steps
to solve a particular problem. </p>

<p>They receive <em>input data</em>, and produce
an <em>output result</em>. </p>

<p>They can be classified by <em>how long</em>
they take to run on a particular input
and the <em>quality</em> of their results,
e.g. the results of a path-finding algorithm, 
e.g. N cities would take N! steps for a 
perfect solution to the traveling salesman problem. 
Instead, we do approximations. </p>

<p>We want to be able to compare algorithmic
efficiency and quality. </p>

<p>Our isFib() was of perfect quality,
but would take N interations/steps. </p>

<p>How many steps for a N amount of input?
N steps? N! steps? </p>

<p>Bad algorithms can kill a program. They make
the difference! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-algorithm-comparison" class="anchor" href="#algorithm-comparison" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm Comparison</h4>

<p>Example: Our program must guess
the word a user guessed. </p>

<p>Possible algorithms:</p>

<p>1: Randomly pick words from the dictionary
   and ask the user if that word is correct.</p>

<p>If there are N words in our dictionary, our
algorithm would find it in N guesses. Why not N/2?
Because <em>we might guess words twice</em>! </p>

<p>// He pulled out a massive dictionary from his backpack!</p>

<p>2: Search linearly from top to bottom and ask user. </p>

<pre><code>repeatedly:
    j = 0; 
    Ask if word j is the wordj++;
</code></pre>

<p>// He keeps selecting </p>

<p>This one will take N/2 steps because words
will in the first half or last half of the dictionary.
The distribution based on loation would center
around the center. This one is twice as fast
as the original. </p>

<p>3: Binary search. </p>

<pre><code>SearchArea = the entire dictionary

while (guess not correct)
{
    Pick middle word w in SearchArea
    Ask user
    If done, yay!

    Else, ask "Word comes before or after w?"
    {
        If before
            SearchArea = first half of current SearchArea
        If after
            SearchArea = second half of current SearchArea
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How long would this take? log2(N). </p>

<p>In the worst case, we keep dividing search area in half until
it contains just a single word. </p>

<p>Ex: N = 16 words, how many times to halve till we have
just one word left? 4 steps, which is log2(16), as it's
2^(?) = N.</p>

<p>Even for N = 131,072 in 17 steps, log2(N), the number of times
we can divide N by 2 until we reach a value of 1. </p>

<p>N = 1 billion? log2(1 billion) = 30. </p>

<p>Compare them! N vs N/2 vs log2(N) steps! This is the power
of a good algorithm vs. a bad one. Example, if we had to
search through a names database. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-data-structures" class="anchor" href="#data-structures" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Structures</h3>

<p>// Carey offered a bumped-up grade if we win one
// of the top three spots in the Code Day hackathon. </p>

<p>A data structure is the data that'ss operated on an
algorithm to solve a problem. </p>

<p>Sometimes, an algorithm can operated just on the 
data passed into it. The data structure alone is
the input data. </p>

<p>Other times, we'll need to create a <em>secondary data structure</em>
for solving a problem. </p>

<p>Example: a data structure that lists friendships. </p>

<p>If we went relationship-by-relationship in an 
unordered list, it would take forever. </p>

<p>A different way to do it, we assign user a number,
and alphabetize by user name. Again, we could use
binary search, which would take log2(N) steps. </p>

<p>Once we have both users' numbers,
we use them and a 2D array to represent
relationships. </p>

<pre><code>0   1   2

1   *

2       *
</code></pre>

<p>We would typically want it to be symmetric,
meaning both people are reflected as being
friends with each other.</p>

<p>To check if a friendship exists, we
get look up numbers, check (A,B) or (B,A),
and see if they're buddies. </p>

<p>HOWEVER, the number of friendships are less
than the number of people. Building a 1 bill by 1 bill
array would be ludicrous. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-data-structure--algorithms" class="anchor" href="#data-structure--algorithms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Structure + Algorithms</h3>

<p>Data structures and algoirthms can become very complex,
and leave another programmer completely confused. </p>

<p>So every time we create some, we also create
simple functions that hide the messy details,
e.g. <code>bool areFriends(string user1, string user2)</code>,
<code>becomeFriends()</code> and <code>breakUp()</code></p>

<p>This is known as an <strong>inteface</strong>. 
They allow us to use and interact with very complex
things simply and easily. </p>

<p>The algorithms and data structures are designed together, 
then create an interface.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-abstract-data-type" class="anchor" href="#abstract-data-type" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract Data Type</h3>

<p>Data structures + algorithms + interface = ADT,
an abstract data type, used for a particular problem. </p>

<p>In an ADT, the data structures and algorithms are
private/secret (the details are irrelevant to the user
or other programs).</p>

<p>To solve big problems, we build sub-solutions and 
put them together. </p>

<p>In C++, classes can be an ADT. </p>

<pre><code>class Name
{
    public: 
        // Interface

    private: 
        // Secret algorithms

        // Secret data structures
}
</code></pre>

<p>We build our program from collections of classes. </p>

<p>If every part of our programs knew how every
other part worked, then they would be
very complex to write, never mind change. </p>

<p>We can change implementation while leaving 
interface alone. </p>

<p>Example: switching out engines in a car, but we
can still drive the same way. </p>

<p>Example: the uniform interface of power outlets;
the source of the power doesn't affect us </p>

<p>// Hehe, he's got an air cannon for waking up sleepers</p>

<p>This is the power of <strong>abstraction</strong>, closely
related to <strong>encapsulation</strong>. </p>

<p>We literally break down big problems into little ones. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-object-oriented-programming" class="anchor" href="#object-oriented-programming" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>OOP is based on the ADT concept. </p>

<p>In OOP, programs are constructed
from multiple, self-contained classes, 
interacting only through public interfaces. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-c-review" class="anchor" href="#c-review" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++ Review</h3>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-c-structs" class="anchor" href="#c-structs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++ structs</h4>

<p>We use structs when we want to group 
related pieces of data into a single variable. </p>

<p>This is defining a whole new type of variable/data. </p>

<p>Syntax: </p>

<pre><code>struct Name
{
    // Members/fields
};
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget the semicolon! </p>

<p><code>struct</code> declarations are normally found
in header files (.h); in source files (.cpp),
we can <code>#include "header.h"</code> to use the 
definition we just wrote. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that all scalar variables
have a random, garbage value when uninitialized.</p>

<p>// Haha, the PPT makes fun of David Smallberg,
// in this case declaring that Carey's GPA &gt; David's</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-c-classes" class="anchor" href="#c-classes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++ Classes</h4>

<p>Classes and structures in C++ are almost
identical (difference was the reversal of private/public
by default), but <em>by convention</em>, classes 
have member functions in addition to member variables. </p>

<p>Lingo: <code>ClassName r, s</code></p>

<p>r and s are "objects" or "instances" or "variables". </p>

<p>Even the primitive data types can have
"instances".</p>

<p>In a class, the data are "member variables"
and the functions are called "member functions"
or "methods". </p>

<p>Variables defined inside a function are known
as "local variables" and used for temporary needs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-c-classes-review" class="anchor" href="#c-classes-review" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++ Classes Review</h3>

<p>By convention, data members are <strong>always</strong>
private. </p>

<p>Also, by default, in <em>classes</em>, everything is
<code>private</code>. But in <em>structs</em>, everything is <code>public</code>
by default. Otherwise, structs and classes are identical
in C++. </p>

<p>Public members are accessible by anything anywhere else
in the program, but private members are accessible only
by members of the class. </p>

<p>"Just remember like how you only touch your own privates."</p>

<p>Heh, then we'll discuss the use of <code>friend</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> means we'll hide the details
and present only a clean, public interface. </p>

<p>Every class is a self-contained problem-solving
unit, an ADT. The rest of the program does not
(and should not) know how it works. </p>

<p>In software dev, we'll start with simple versions
of classes, and improve them with time, even as
the rest of the program doesn't have to change. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-constructors" class="anchor" href="#constructors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Constructors</h4>

<p>Constructors automatically initialize new variables.</p>

<p>Syntax for declaration: </p>

<pre><code>ClassName
{
    // Constructor
    ClassName(parameters);
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>So now when we construct new objects, those arguments
must be passed to the constructor (unless we have a default
public constructor that doesn't take any parameters). </p>

<p>Syntax for definition: </p>

<pre><code>ClassName::ClassName(parameters)
{
    m_member = parameter1;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is <em>no return type</em> for a constructor.</p>

<p>The return statement can be used in a constructor,
but it just terminates the function. It cannot
return a value; it's used to end the constructor early. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>ClassName::ClassName(parameters)
{
    ...
    if (condition)
        return; // End early

    // Don't execute the remaining code below
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, like other member functions, constructors can
be defined inside or outside of the class. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-default-parameters" class="anchor" href="#default-parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Default Parameters</h4>

<p>In the parameter listing, default parameters
can be given:</p>

<pre><code>CSNerd(int PCs, bool usesMac = true)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows: </p>

<pre><code>CSNerd Ned(5); 

// One argument passed; other one uses default
</code></pre>

<p>But: </p>

<pre><code>CSNerd Alan;
</code></pre>

<p>Will still give an error. </p>

<p>Also, <em>default parameters must be right-justified</em>.
No left-side or middle parameters may be default.
All can be default. If something is default,
everything to the right of it must also be default
(or that parameter needs to be moved to the right).</p>

<p>What if we have two defaults and we pass one argument?
It'll go to the left-most parameter, even if both
parameters accept the same data type. </p>

<p><strong>We pass arguments in the order of the parameters!</strong></p>

<a id="user-content-overloading-constructors" class="anchor" href="#overloading-constructors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overloading Constructors</h4>

<p>We can have multiple constructors, as long as
they <em>differ in the number of or type</em> of parameters.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we have <em>ambiguity</em>. </p>

<p>Question: Will the error happen at compile-time or when
we actually try to construct an object with ambiguous arguments?</p>

<p>If no constructors are no defined, a default constructor
is implicitly defined that does not nothing at all:</p>

<p>"I do nothing at all. I'm like a USC student!!!!!!"</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this means that member variables are left
uninitialized. </p>

<p>If <em>we want an array of a class type</em>, we <em>must have</em> a
<em>default public constructor</em> that takes no arguments!
Alternatively, we can have a constructor that has
default arguments for everything. C++ just needs some
constructor that doesn't require arguments.</p>

<p>When we define that array, the constructor will run 
to construct objects for every element in that array. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-initializer-lists" class="anchor" href="#initializer-lists" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initializer Lists</h4>

<p>WE can do intialize members with the constructor,
OR we can do an <strong>initializer list</strong></p>

<pre><code>CSNerd(int PCs, bool usesMac)
    : m_numPCs(PCs), m_macUser(usesMac)
    // No semicolon after the list
{
    // Any other constructor stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>Syntax: </p>

<pre><code>ClassName(parameters)
    : member(value), member (parameter)
</code></pre>

<p>The initializer list is with the constructor
body definition; don't leave it in the header
while putting the body in the source file; that'd
be weird. </p>

<p>If we really wanted to, we can mix the two
initialization techniques together. </p>

<p>Also, the curly braces are still needed, but
they don't need to contain anything. </p>

<pre><code>class CSProf
{
    public: 
        CSProf(const string&amp; name, int age = 39)
            : m_name(name), m_age(age)
        {
            // EMPTY
        }

    private:
        string m_name; 
        int m_age;
}; 
</code></pre>

<p>OR: </p>

<pre><code>CSProf(string name, int age = 39)
{
    m_name = name; 
    m_age = age;
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR: </p>

<pre><code>CSProf(string name, int age = 39)
    : m_name(name)
{
    m_age = age; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR: </p>

<pre><code>CSProf(string name, int age = 39)
    : m_age(age)
{
    m_name = name; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, these should <code>const string&amp;</code>,
for efficiency and to maintain error-checking
since we don't need to change the passed string. </p>

<p>Also, all of these can be done outside of the class 
too: </p>

<p><strong>Default parameters go in the declaration/prototype</strong></p>

<pre><code>class CSProf
{
    CSProf(const string&amp; name, const int age = 39);
    ...
};

CSProf::CSProf(const string&amp; name, const int age)
{
    m_name = name; 
    m_age  = age;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The PBCR isn't needed for primitives unless
we want to avoid changing variables being passed
into the constructor. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-destructors" class="anchor" href="#destructors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Destructors</h4>

<p>There may be only <em>one</em> destructor in a class. </p>

<p>It de-initializes a class variable once it goes
away, i.e. passes out of scope. This will happen
automatically. </p>

<p>Syntax: </p>

<pre><code>// In-line, in-class definition
~ClassName()
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR:     </p>

<pre><code>ClassName::~ClassName()

</code></pre>

<p>NO return-types or parameters allowed. </p>

<p>// Haha, he embedded the Simpsons theme
// song in his PowerPoint</p>

<p>When we don't have a destructor, we
never free up needed resources. </p>

<p><em>Destructors can call member functions.</em></p>

<p>When are destructors needed? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>System resources are allocated (e.g. with <code>new</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>We open a disk file (we need to close it)</p></li>
<li><p>We open a network connection (we need to disconnect)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>There is no way to way to manually call the destructor.</em></p>

<p>When are destructors called? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>When local variables pass out of scope (a code block ends)</p></li>
<li><p><code>delete</code> is called on dynamically-allocated variables
(don't forget the <code>delete</code>!)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-class-composition" class="anchor" href="#class-composition" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Class Composition</h3>

<p>This is when a class contains one more other
classes as member variables. </p>

<p>Example: class Car contains a variable
of type GasTank. </p>

<p>This can embed deeply. </p>

<p><em>A class may not have a member of its own type,</em>
<em>but it may have a pointer to a one of its type.</em></p>

<p>The outer class may call the public functions
of its inner class member, and use them anywhere
in the outer class, including in its constructor
and destructor. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-initializer-list" class="anchor" href="#initializer-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initializer List</h3>

<p>Before, we've seen constructors be used to intialize
a newly-created instance of a class.</p>

<p>They worked like this: </p>

<pre><code>ClassName::ClassName(_type1 arg1, _type2 arg2)
{
    _type1 m_var1 = arg1;
    _type2 m_var2 = arg2;

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to do this is with an initializer list:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName::ClassName(_type1 arg1, _type2 arg2)
    : m_var1(arg1), m_var2(arg2)
{
    // A body is required, even if empty
}
</code></pre>

<p>These initializer lists will allow us to handle
class composition and inheritance. They also allow
us to have const and reference member variables,
which must be initialized on the same line that 
they are declared. Trying to do assignment via
a regular constructor body is too late.</p>

<p>Example of what won't work:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

using namespace std;

class Test
{
    public: 
        Test(int i)
        {
            m_test1 = 1;
            m_test2 = i;
        }

    private:
        const int m_test1;
        int&amp; m_test2;
};


int main() 
{
    Test t(10);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Clang fires back an error that "the constructor
for Test must explicitly initialize the member
variable m_test2"</p>

<p>For m_test1, it notes that a read-only variable
is not assignable, indicating the const property
is in effect before we attempted to initialize;
it's "initialized" with junk data instead. </p>

<p>This can be fixed with:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

using namespace std;

class Test
{
public:
    Test(int i) : m_test1(1), m_test2(i)
    {
    }

private:
    const int m_test1;
    int&amp; m_test2;
};


int main()
{
    Test t(10);
}
</code></pre>

<a id="user-content-construction-order" class="anchor" href="#construction-order" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Construction Order</h4>

<p>But what happens with the constructors
for the classes? </p>

<p>Example, we construct a Nerd object, 
which contains a Stomach object. Which constrcuctor
runs first? </p>

<p>Hint: If the outer class' constructor uses
the inner class-type object, the object of the inner class
type must be constructed first. </p>

<p><strong>Construction order: inner classes --&gt; outer outer</strong></p>

<p>Another example: Valve --&gt; Heart --&gt; TinMan</p>

<p>Also, note that any members that of a class-type
(e.g. strings) will also be constructed first. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-destruction-order" class="anchor" href="#destruction-order" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Destruction Order</h4>

<p>A Nerd destructor may use the Stomach object,
so we can't afford to destruct it when it's still
needed. </p>

<p><strong>So destruction order goes outer --&gt; inner</strong></p>

<p>Note that destructors will automatically run
as long as the variables are automatic ones. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-advanced-class-composition" class="anchor" href="#advanced-class-composition" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced Class Composition</h3>

<p>What happens if we have a member for an outer
class, and this member is of a class type 
that requires parameters for its constructor? </p>

<p>Then, to make this work, we have to pass
parameter to the inner class constructor. </p>

<p>Even if Nerd's constructor passes
values to its Stomach member variable, 
that won't be done in time. It has to
be done with an initializer list. This list
can take arguments given to the outer constructor
and pass it to inner constructor, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>CSNerd(int farts)
    : belly(farts)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think C++11's support for default values
in the class declaration will work either. 
We'd have to do an explicit constructor call? </p>

<p>What if we have default arguments? Then the
full initializer list not required, but we may still have it. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-include-directives" class="anchor" href="#include-directives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#include Directives</h3>

<p>For headers that are not pre-included as part
of the Standard Library, like ones that we create,
we need to:</p>

<pre><code>#include "HeaderName.h"
</code></pre>

<p>Compare this to the syntax for pre-included headers:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;header&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the "" and the .h (which is omitted for library
headers, except for a few deprecated ones like string.h).</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-include-guards" class="anchor" href="#include-guards" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#include Guards</h4>

<p>There's actually a problem with the above
Watch class example: what if we tried to #include
Watch.h multiple times? The answer is an error.
C++ does not allow us to redefine something; one of its
rules is the <strong>One Definition Rule</strong>. </p>

<p>Remember that we can avoid this with things declared
in different scopes or namespaces (which we'll see shortly).</p>

<p>Avoiding this manually would be tricky. Header files can
call upon another; this layering can be very deep indeed.</p>

<p>The solution? Guard our headers.</p>

<p>If we do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef HEADER_H
#define HEADER_H

// Class declaration

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Then the compiler will check if HEADER_H has
been defined on a list of "code already seen". 
If it is, it will skip to the next #endif, smartly
placed <em>after</em> the end of the class definition. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we #define ("Yes, compiler, this class
has now been seen and declared.") and declare
the class. The #endif would be ignored in that case. </p>

<p>The #define can "define" any non-keyword, though
convention is to use the header name in all caps,
with an underscore in place of the dot.</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef // also exists and does the obvious
</code></pre>

<p>These macros, as they're known, can be used outside
of header files as well. </p>

<p>Additional ones:</p>

<pre><code>#if         // IF
#elif       // ELSE IF
#else       // ELSE
#line       // Used as #line &lt;number&gt; "New file name"

// Any error that follows this #line directive
// will have a line number that uses the specified number
// as a starting point and the containing
// file name as specified by the directive

#error      // Followed by an error message, no quotes
            // Hint: use it in combo with control flow

#pragma     // Specifies compiler options; compiler-specific
            // Ignored if the specific #pragma statement is
            // not supported by that compiler, though stricter
            // warning flags will note the ignoring
</code></pre>

<p>There are also predefined macros like:</p>

<pre><code>__LINE__
__FILE__
__DATE__
__TIME__
__cplusplus // Gives an integer indicating the C++ standard
            // that the compiler conforms to; 201103 indicates
            // C++11

__STD__HOSTED__ // 1 if the local C++ implementation includes all
                // standard header files; 0 otherwise
</code></pre>

<p>All of these statements with a # preceding them
are directives for the <strong>preprocessor</strong> which will
follow these directives before compilation. Note
that they are not followed by a semicolon and that they can
only reside one line; they are considered ended by the first
newline character following them.</p>

<p>To have directives stretch across more than one line:</p>

<pre><code>#directive\
second line of directive
</code></pre>

<p>For details: <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/</a></p>

<p>Returning to our watch example:</p>

<p>// Watch.h</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef WATCH_H
#define WATCH_H


typedef unsigned short ushort;

class Watch
{
    public: 

        // Self-explanatory functions

        void setHour(ushort hour);
        void setMinute(ushort minute);
        void replaceBattery();

    private:
        // This implementation has no need for
        // negative numbers

        ushort m_hr; 
        ushort m_min;
        ushort m_perc_batt;

}; // Don't forget the semicolon!

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Note that #include guards are not needed for implementation
files; they implement, not declare (though they might
<code>#include</code> other headers--which should already be guarded!).</p>

<p>Even with #include guards, headers should not be included
unless necessary.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-include-etiquette" class="anchor" href="#include-etiquette" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Include Etiquette</h4>

<p><strong>Never</strong> include a source file (.cpp) in another
source or header file (.h). All sorts of stupid linker
errors will result otherwise. </p>

<p><strong>Never</strong> put <code>using namespace</code> in a header file.</p>

<p>This is known as <em>namespace pollution</em>: any file that includes
that header is forced to use that namespace, which can
lead to all sorts of errors. Instead, any such statements
should be in the implementing source file instead. </p>

<p><strong>Always</strong> include header files whenever they are directly
needed. <strong>Never</strong> assume that one header file will include
another one. Better safe than sorry, especially since
include guards should be implemented for all headers. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-when-to-include" class="anchor" href="#when-to-include" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When to #include</h5>

<p>We don't actually always need to <code>#include</code>.</p>

<p>When we <em>do</em> need to #include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We create an object of that class type</p></li>
<li>
<p>We use such an object in any way:</p>

<ul>
<li>We call its methods</li>
<li>We return the object itself from a function</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When we do <em>not</em> need to #include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When we have a class-type object as a</p>

<ul>
<li>Parameter for a function</li>
<li>Return-type for a function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When we point or refer to a class-type object</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can still #include, but we do not need to
(and indeed, should not, so as to avoid infinite
including-type problems, which we'll see in a moment).</p>

<p>Instead, simply declare the class' existence
(before it's needed, a <strong>forward-declaration</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>class UsedClass;
</code></pre>

<p>This also speeds up the compilation process,
as header files can be quite large. </p>

<p>NB: If we only declare the class' existence
but do not include it, and then try to do something
that requires the full class definition,
then we will get syntax errors.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-self-referential-headers" class="anchor" href="#self-referential-headers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Self-Referential Headers</h4>

<p>If two classes both refer to each other,
and both try to include each other's headers,
we'll get a compile error. </p>

<p>Why? Because the two files will keep including 
each other!</p>

<p>Example: A.h includes B.h and B.h includes A.h</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p>A includes B which includes A which includes B
which includes A...</p>

<p>Avoid this via the fact that at least ONE
of the two should not need to include the full
class!</p>

<p>NB: Class declarations cannot have full inline
definitions for any functions that use another class
in a way that requires their full definition.</p>

<p>Those function definitions will have to go
in the implementing source file instead. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-pointers-review" class="anchor" href="#pointers-review" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pointers Review</h3>

<p>Note that an array name by itself 
acts like a pointer (printing it out
would give the memory address of the first
element) but it is NOT a pointer itself,
which is a variable (with memory allocated
for itself) that holds the
memory address of another variable.</p>

<p>A pointer to an array can be used just
as if it were the array itself. </p>

<p>Don't forget that pointers + some number
means to move forward in memory by the size
of the data type that the pointer is meant to point to. </p>

<p>We do not move forward by bytes but instead
by doubles or ints, etc. Eg, move forward
two ints and it might go from 9240 to </p>

<p>Set-up:</p>

<pre><code>int nums[3] = {...};

int *ptr = nums;
</code></pre>

<p>Equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>ptr[2];
*(ptr + 2);
</code></pre>

<p>The pointer arithmetic:</p>

<pre><code>ptr[j] --&gt; *(ptr + j);
</code></pre>

<p>This is adding a pointer and
an index, but we cannot add
pointers together. </p>

<p>Pointer subtraction is defined,
with the result being how many integers
are between them (if both point
into the same array), NOT the number
of bytes between them. </p>

<p>Also, commutativity:</p>

<pre><code>j[ptr] --&gt; *(j + ptr);
</code></pre>

<p>What happens if we </p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; nums + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>nums is an address, so + 1 would
print out the address 1 int away. </p>

<a id="user-content-passing-arrays-to-functions" class="anchor" href="#passing-arrays-to-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Passing Arrays to Functions</h3>

<p>When we pass arrays, we just pass
the address of the start of the array, 
not the whole entire array itself.</p>

<p>That's why we can have these as equivalent: </p>

<pre><code>void function(int array[]);
void function(int* array);
</code></pre>

<p>This means we can do something like: </p>

<pre><code>function(&amp;array[j]);
</code></pre>

<p>This means that anything meant to act
on an array can be made to act on 
a later subset of the array instead. </p>

<p>Note, however, that the function 
will not know the array's size
unless we pass in another argument
meant to represent that. </p>

<p>-1 is also usable as a subscript value.
It'll move backward that many types in memory.</p>

<p>Note that the passed array must have 
base type matching the expected parameter. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-copy-constructors" class="anchor" href="#copy-constructors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Copy Constructors</h3>

<p>We have a problem with the way we're currently
designing classes. </p>

<p>Whenever they dynamically allocate memory,
open files, open Internet connections, etc.,
a certain amount of those resources are allocated
to the object of that class type.</p>

<p>The problem is if we have a function that takes
one of those objects by value, or if we make 
a new object based on an old one. </p>

<p>By default, C++ implicitly defines a
default copy constructor (just like how it 
defines default constructors and destructors)
that does a <em>shallow copy</em>.</p>

<p>The new object's members are copies of the old
one's. However, this extends to pointers pointing
to anything dynamically allocated, meaning the new
object will think the old's dynamic members are its own.</p>

<p>So we need a copy constructor that does what
we intend: make a copy, but one that has its own stuff. </p>

<p>Syntax: </p>

<pre><code>// This is still a constructor, so no return-type

// const as we don't need to change the old one
// PBR for efficiency, as objects can have many
// members

//  UPDATE (14 September 2015): 
// According to http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/y8hv0pDG/
// the copy constructor must have one of these signatures:
//      MyClass( const MyClass&amp; other );
//      MyClass( MyClass&amp; other );
//      MyClass( volatile const MyClass&amp; other );
//      MyClass( volatile MyClass&amp; other );
//
// Otherwise, if we have this: MyClass(MyClass other), 
// we're calling the copy constructor as part of the copy constructor!
// Infinite loop! Note that while the pointer versions of these
// could work, they are not considered valid CC's by the standard

ClassName(const ClassName&amp; old)
{
    // 1. Allocate new resources for the new object
    // 2. Copy over the appropriate values from old to new
}

<a id="user-content-dynamic-variables" class="anchor" href="#dynamic-variables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dynamic Variables</h4>

<p>Traditional, <code>local variables</code> are like
rooms in a house. But then we run out of space
with so many visiting relatives, and we call up
a hotel, which reserves some rooms, much like
<code>dynamic memory</code>. The overflow relatives
will be placed there instead. </p>

<p>Don't forget to free up the allocated space. 
Tell the hotel that your relatives went home! </p>

<p>What happens if that relative forgets
something in the room? Will that object
still be there? Maybe, maybe not. Someone
else may have taken the room. </p>

<p>Dynamic memory that is released, and we
follow the pointer to it may give the original 
value, or something totally different altogether.</p>

<p>Don't dereference dangling pointers!</p>

<p>With the <code>new</code> command, we can have dynamic arrays:</p>

<pre><code>cin &gt;&gt; size; 

int *array = new int[size]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the pointer type and array base type
match!</p>

<pre><code>array[0] = num1; 
array[1] = num2; 

*(array + #) = ...;

...

delete [] array;
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>delete []</code> for anything allocated as an array. 
Use <code>delete</code> for anything allocated as a single item.</p>

<p><strong>Remember: do not <code>delete</code> automatic variables</strong></p>

<p><em>Do not <code>delete</code> anything twice!</em> </p>

<p>(Unless it's a nullptr; deleting a nullptr is harmless). </p>

<p>There's no need to <code>delete</code> anything that was not
dynamically allocated.  </p>

<p>Delete means that we're done with memory at some
location; the amount of memory used (starting at
that location) is handled by the OS's memory allocator. </p>

<p>Just remember that the pointer is left alone (its
memory address still points to storage is now deallocated). 
Change it to null and have functions check for null
(before using their pointer parameters) as a safety measure. </p>

<p>Remember that declaring a pointer to an object
does not create that object unless we actually
do the <code>new</code> command!</p>

<p>Don't mix-up the two versions of delete. 
Just check how the item to be deleted
was allocated (it may not even need delete,
as with automatic variables). </p>

<p>If we use the wrong delete, it is <em>undefined behavior</em>,
and able to cause a crash.  </p>

<p>What if <code>new</code> calls for too much memory? 
e.g. we want 32 billion bytes of memory (4 billion doubles). </p>

<p>The runtime will throw an exception--and our code can
try to catch it somewhere, but if we don't: the program will crash. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-dynamic-class-members" class="anchor" href="#dynamic-class-members" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dynamic Class Members</h4>

<p>A handy way to customize objects is to have
their constructors take arguments
that are fed (in some form) to an internal
implementation that dynamically allocates
stuff to that specified size. </p>

<p>This means we'll only use as much memory
as needed (and not have to waste memory 
trying to plan for the maximum amount 
likely needed). </p>

<p>Just note that constructor arguments
are in the scope of the constructor definition 
ONLY. To use those arguments in other member functions,
store them as data members. Otherwise, they'll go out
of scope once the constructor is done running. </p>

<p>Don't forget to add a destructor as well. </p>

<p>Because <code>delete</code> should not be called on something
that is uninitialized (that pointer will lead
to who knows where), be sure to initialize
member pointers to nullptr (e.g. with Pets
that <em>may</em> have a favorite Toy). </p>

<p>There are some technical issues with <code>NULL</code>,
and so C++11 introduced <code>nullptr</code>. As long as 
the compiler supports nullptr, we should use it. </p>

<p>Also, remember the big three of memory management: 
if we need a destructor, then we probably need
a copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator
as well. </p>

<p>Yes, we can dynamically allocate and deallocate
structs and classes. </p>

<p>That is a two-part process.</p>

<p>First, memory is allocated, then second, 
the object's constructor is called to create it. </p>

<p>Deletion would mean the reverse:
the destructor is called to clean up any
internal dynamic member variables, then
the memory is declared as available to the OS. </p>

<p>A destructor can be used to do something right
before a class instance is about to disappear. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-namespaces" class="anchor" href="#namespaces" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Namespaces</h3>

<p>In C++, all code is always in a namespace. </p>

<p>Across different namespaces, the same
names/identifiers might be attached to totally
different things. </p>

<p>Consider how we might a friend named Bob
and a boss named Bob. Among our friends, who 
do not know our boss, it's very unlikely
that they'll think we're talking about our boss
when we say "Bob". </p>

<p>On the other hand, our coworkers would think
in the opposite manner. </p>

<p>The meaning of the name depends on context. </p>

<p>With C++, we strictly control what and how
everything is defined in a particular context,
as well as control what contexts exist and 
when they're used. </p>

<p>Previously, we used <code>using namespace std</code>. 
This meant that all the names defined for
the C++ standard library were being used.
Whenever we said <code>cout</code>, we meant the one
found in , not some other version
that we designed ourselves. </p>

<p>If we did not use an explicit namespace,
then our code resided in the <strong>global namespace</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>We can use multiple namespaces,
but we can never use more than one
at a time.</p>

<hr>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-creating-a-namespace" class="anchor" href="#creating-a-namespace" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a Namespace</h4>

<p>To place some code into a new namespace,
place it into a <strong>namespace grouping</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>namespace cool 
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The names in that code now reside in the
namespace <code>cool</code>.</p>

<p>To make these names available to other 
code, use a using-directive (<code>using namespace</code>)
or a using-declaration (<code>using cool::</code>)</p>

<p>Note that we can have any number of namespace
groupings for a namespace, even across multiple
files, and all those names will still be in the
same namespace. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-using-directives" class="anchor" href="#using-directives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using-directives</h4>

<p>To use a different namespace:</p>

<p>We can have a <strong>using-directive</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>using namespace &lt;space&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes all of the names in that
namespace available, and, crucially,
it does not allow any other use of
those names.</p>

<p>Its scope is from the directive's 
declaration to the end of a block
of code, or, if it was declared in
the global namespace, till the end
of the file.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that we use
a list of using-declarations rather than 
using-directives, <em>especially</em> at the global level.</p>

<p>Any using-directives should be limited
in scope to specific blocks.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-using-declaration" class="anchor" href="#using-declaration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using-declaration</h4>

<p>Sometimes, we only want specific names
from a namespace, or we have two namespaces
that use some of the same names. </p>

<p>To cleanly intermix the two (that is,
not use the same names from different
namespaces at once), we can use
a using-declaration:</p>

<pre><code>using &lt;space&gt;::
</code></pre>

<p>Its scope is from the declaration's 
appearance to the end of a block
of code, or, if it appeared in
the global namespace, till the end
of the file.</p>

<p>Now, we make only specific names
available and can switch between
namespaces as needed for overlapping
names.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-qualifying-namespaces" class="anchor" href="#qualifying-namespaces" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Qualifying Namespaces</h4>

<p>Having a using-directive or using-declaration
isn't strictly necessary.</p>

<p>For example, many of the functions found
in the std namespace will have parameters
like this:</p>

<pre><code>void function(std::type parameterName);
</code></pre>

<p>This means that we're using the name from
the std namespace.</p>

<p>Having a <code>using namespace std</code> or <code>using std::</code>
would just mean we could omit the <code>std::</code>,
but then we could not define that name.</p>

<p>Thus, everywhere we've seen <code>cout</code>, where
it's used as found in , we could have
written <code>std::cout</code>.</p>

<p>We’re also able to use this qualification
technique even when another parameter has the 
same name:</p>

<pre><code>void function(std::name parameter, name parameter);
</code></pre>

<p>The first will use the name found in std, the
second the name found in the global namespace
(or in the namespace given by a preceding
using-declaration or using-directive). </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-copy-construction" class="anchor" href="#copy-construction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Copy Construction</h3>

<p>What happens when we code something like: </p>

<pre><code>Circle b(...); 

Circle a = b; 
</code></pre>

<p>This means that we created an object <code>b</code>
of class type Circle. </p>

<p>Then, we created another object <code>a</code>, also
of type Circle, which is meant to have the 
values of B. </p>

<p>This is construction that is based off an
existing class-type object.</p>

<p>We will be <em>copying</em> it. </p>

<p>The problem is when we have dynamic members. 
The memory addresses stored in the member
pointers (pointing to those dynamic objects)
will be copied verbatim. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-syntax" class="anchor" href="#syntax" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Syntax</h4>

<pre><code>ClassName(const ClassName&amp; existing)
{
    m_member = existing.member;
    ...

// In general:

    // 1. Allocate memory for the new instance
    // 2. Copy values from existing to new instances
}
</code></pre>

<p>So here's a cool thing. We're accessing 
the member variables of another object. How?
A class has access to all its members! </p>

<p>We can talk about private class members
within that class. A copy constructor is
a member function that can access private
class members. There is no additional rule
that we can only access the object we're currently 
operating on. This is precisely so that we can
do stuff like copy constructors. </p>

<p>This allows to have calls like:</p>

<pre><code>// Similar to any other constructor call
ClassName b(a);
</code></pre>

<p>Equivalent to: </p>

<pre><code>// I actually think assignment operator
// with this. It's a good challenge to 
// identify when = is used, and when
// the copy constructor is called

ClassName b = a; 
</code></pre>

<p>This means "initialize <code>b</code> based on <code>a</code>".</p>

<p>This is the old syntax we've seen as
an (awkward) alternative: <code>int a(16)</code>;</p>

<p>Normally, we use this parantheses syntax
for initializer lists instead (which requires them). </p>

<p>Remember that compilers are checking what was passed to
functions and looks for what's needed among the pool
of defined ones. </p>

<p><strong>A copy constructor is a member function used</strong>
<strong>to create a <em>new</em> variable from an <em>existing</em> one</strong></p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName(const ClassName&amp; existing)
</code></pre>

<p>We will almost always PBCR. We don't want
to change something we're simply copy (unless
we have a data member that counts how many times
something has been copied, for example) and we
want to pass objects by reference for memory efficiency
reasons. </p>

<p>The funny thing is if we PBV, which would involve
calling the copy constructor for itself? Recursion!</p>

<p>Note that a default one will be provided which copies
member variables from the old instance to the new instance.
However, this implicit default could be inefficient,
doing a <em>shallow copy</em> that copies everything,
even if it doesn't need to be copied (e.g. an array with
unused elements). </p>

<p>To be more precise, we copy the <em>value</em> of every member
variable from the existing instance to the new instance. </p>

<p>// Haha, Smallberg loves seeing the animated robot's head spin</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-deep-copying" class="anchor" href="#deep-copying" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep Copying</h4>

<p>The problem is when we have class type that involves
dynamically allocated stuff. </p>

<p>Then, a shallow copy would copy over the contents
of pointers to objects; meaning two objects shared
the same dynamic variables!</p>

<p>Thus, if a destructor with <code>delete</code> statements is
called on one of them and the other one
tries to use that dynamic variable, we'd be following
a dangling pointer!</p>

<p>There's all sorts of logical errors that could spring up
too: objects that aren't initialized correctly, etc.</p>

<p>To solve this, we need a <em>deep copy</em>, where we copy
the what is being pointed to, rather than the pointers
themselves. This means that we'll be setting up a new 
object with new pointers to newly allocated dynamic
variables, and then giving those variables values
identical to the ones of the old object. </p>

<p>Again, any time a class allocates things in memory
dynamically or accesses system resources (e.g. opening
a file), it must have a copy constructor implemented!</p>

<p>This copy constructor then will have to create a 
a new object that has the same amount of dynamic 
memory allocated and then copies over values
into those dynamic variables. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-the-importance-of-ccs" class="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-ccs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Importance of CC's</h4>

<p><em>Copy constructors are used *anytime</em> we make a new copy
of an existing class instance. We do that when we 
PBV to functions! </p>

<p>If we say "copy" while describing the operation of something,
we're probably calling the copy constructor as part of the
process. We call a function that takes its parameters by value:</p>

<ol>
<li>PBV function is called. </li>
<li>Copy constructor is called. </li>
<li>CC creates temporary class instance that is a copy of the argument</li>
<li>The function acts upon this temporary copy </li>
</ol>

<p>What happens when we have dynamic data members? </p>

<p>We might have a PBV function that takes a class instance, 
which calls the CC. The function then acts upon that copy.</p>

<p>The problem: we pass out of scope, and that copy goes out
of scope. A destructor is called. The dynamic members are deallocated. </p>

<p><em>However</em>, the existing instance used as a basis
for that copy is also modified. Why? Because the shallow
copy had the member pointers pointing to the same locations
in memory; both instances thought a particular section of 
memory belonged to them. This resulted from the dumb
copy of pointer to pointer. Both stored the same memory address. </p>

<p>This alone is a problem. </p>

<p>However, that destructor run means that the existing
instance is left in an <em>invalid state</em> with a dangling
pointer to dyanmic members that it thinks still exist.</p>

<p>Once we have dynamic variables, we must write our
own destructor and copy constructor. This is also true
for if we open system resources (files, network connections, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Always ask</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do I need a destructor?</li>
<li>Do I need a copy constructor? </li>
<li>Do I need overloaded operators (especially for assignment)? </li>
</ol>

<p>"A copy constructor should create an object that looks
like the original object, but is independent of it."</p>

<p>We want clones of a person; we don't want the original person
and their clones sharing internal organs!</p>

<p>Thus far, we have not needed CC's, because it hadn't made
sense (or wasn't necessary) to create a new Zombie, Player,
Arena, etc. based off of an existing one. </p>

<p>Instead, when we did need something like that,
e.g. with strings, the Standard Library took care of
that for us. Dynamic members of library types had
their own copy constructors called! This means
that once we properly design and implement classes,
even if they use dyanmic storage, we can stop worrying 
about it. </p>

<p>Also, if we return a class-type object from a function
that has a non-reference return-type, then the copy constructor
is called for that return statement. We'd be returning something
that's getting destructed otherwise. </p>

<p>Time to make operators work
with our class types!</p>

<p>Note that operators can be overloaded
in a class, outside of it, or as a friend</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-basics" class="anchor" href="#basics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basics</h4>

<p>Operators like +, -, *, /, etc. are really just
functions with a different syntax. </p>

<p>Their arguments (often called <em>operands</em> in this context)
might fall on either side of them instead of being 
passed in enclosed in a pair of parantheses. </p>

<p>Just like with functions, we can overload operators,
which allows us to tweak their behavior to accommodate
the class types that we define. We get control over
what it means to "add" two objects of type Country together,
as an example. </p>

<p>Most (but not all) operators can be overloaded 
(and some that can, should not be). </p>

<p><strong>At least one operand to an overloaded operator must be</strong>
<strong>of a class type!</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Don't overload <code>,</code> or <code>||</code> or <code>&amp;&amp;</code></p>

<p>The associativity of the first and the short-circuiting
of the latter two will disappear otherwise. </p>

<p>Also, only existing operators can be overloaded;
we cannot create new ones.</p>

<p>The general syntax is this (for a binary operator): </p>

<pre><code>const ClassName operator +(const ClassName&amp; one, const ClassName&amp; two); 
</code></pre>

<p>The operands may be PBV or PBR and not necessarily <code>const</code>. 
The returned value may be of any type, including <code>void</code>. </p>

<p>The <code>const</code> constraint on the returned type will be explained
in a bit. </p>

<p>Note that this particular method of overloading
means that the operator will <em>not</em> have access to the private
members of the class, and so will rely on its public
interface to accomplish its job.</p>

<p>Again, this is a <em>non-member function operator overload</em>.</p>

<p>It is possible to overload operators as member functions,
which we'll also see.</p>

<p>Overloading operators should allow them to function
in the way we expect, i.e. similar to how the built-in
operators function with primitive types. Thus,
an overloaded <code>==</code> operator should return a <code>bool</code>,
which allows its use in <code>if</code> statements. For example:</p>

<pre><code>if (USA == UK)
{
    cerr &lt;&lt; "The Doctor is interfering with the timeline!\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-tip-constructors-returning-objects" class="anchor" href="#tip-constructors-returning-objects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tip: Constructors Returning Objects</h5>

<p>Constructors can sometimes be thought of
as returning an object. That is, that they
are replaced in the code by the object they create.</p>

<p>Unless, we assign them to something,
these objects are not tied to any named variable,
and so are called <strong>anonymous objects</strong>. They
are full objects though, and can even be 
used as calling objects (i.e., invoke
their public member functions). </p>

<p>This is very useful for operator overloading,
as we might perform internal calculations
for adding two objects together and then input
those internal results into the constructor
to be returned:</p>

<pre><code>// Calculations

return ClassName(finalResult1, finalResult2); 
</code></pre>

<p>This is far cleaner than:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName temp;

// Calculations

temp = ClassName(finalResult1, finalResult2); 

return temp;
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, this might lead to issues if the class
uses dynamic allocation and we didn't overload
the assignment operator correctly (a copy
constructor would not be used, as <code>temp</code> was
already created and initialized when we called
the assignment operator). </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-returning-by-const-value" class="anchor" href="#returning-by-const-value" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Returning by const Value</h4>

<p>The reason we often to elect
to make the value returned by an operator
<code>const</code> is this: automatic error checking
by preventing inadvertent changes to
a returned object. </p>

<p>Consider this: </p>

<pre><code>m3 = (m1 + m2);
</code></pre>

<p><code>(m1 + m2)</code> is a variable of a class type,
but <code>m3</code> is an object of the same clss type. </p>

<p>It's possible to do something like <code>(m1 + m2).input()</code>,
which invokes a member function that changes
member variables. If the operator <code>+</code> returns
a <code>const</code> value though, this will generate an
error. </p>

<p>The default assignment operator will do
a shallow copy: it copies the values of member
variables from one object to another. </p>

<p>This is also why we're returning by value here:
we're copying the anonoymous object created by
the addition operation into m3.</p>

<p>If we returned by reference, we'd have a 
reference to something that might be passing 
out of scope very soon (e.g. as with the 
local variables of an operator
overload definition). </p>

<p>Think about it this way also:
are we generating a value or modifying
an existing one? </p>

<p>Ex: 1 + 2 = 3.</p>

<p>3 is a new value (which can be stored [copied]
into an existing or new variable) but the assigment
operator (which we'll see later) is used
to modify an existing one. </p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<pre><code>fullAmount = baseAmount + 25; 
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>+</code> operator returned by constant reference,
<code>baseAmount</code> would be changed, even though we likely
intended "fullAmount is equal to baseAmount + 25",
which does NOT imply changing baseAmount; rather,
we just needs value temporarily for a calculation.</p>

<p>So, for the most part, return by const value. </p>

<p><code>=</code> assignment is an exception, as it explicitly
calls for changing an existing object. </p>

<p>Note that if an operator returns
a primitive type, returning it as a <code>const</code>
is pointless, though legal. This is why
the code examples for overloading <code>==</code> 
omitted the <code>const</code> before the <code>bool</code> return-type.</p>

<p>When used all by itself, the <code>-</code> is
the negation operator, not the subtraction
operator. </p>

<p>It is a <em>unary</em> operator that takes only
<em>one</em> operand. </p>

<p>Consider a class Account that stores
the amount of money in a bank account.</p>

<p>Then, we can overload the negation operator
to support Account-class objects:</p>

<pre><code>class Account
{
    public:
        ...
        Amount(double money);

        // Short definitions can be inline
        double amount() const
        {
            return m_amt;
        }
        ...

    private:
        ...
        double m_amt;
}


// Declaration of negation operator overload
const Account&amp; operator -(const Account&amp; old);

int main()
{
    ...
}

// Negation operator overload implementation
const Account&amp; operator -(const Account&amp; old)
{
    return Account( -old.amount() )
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since this overload happens outside of the class,
we need to use public member functions to
implement the overload. In this case, we also
use the default behavior of the negation operator
with a primitive type. </p>

<p>This is the power of abstraction: we can build 
and build on top of previous work without 
worrying about how it works--so long as it works, haha. </p>

<p>Operators can be overloaded as class member
functions too; this will grant them access to
all private members--not just those of the
calling object, but of any defined class
object too (e.g. the second operand is also
a class object). </p>

<p>With binary operators, there's a syntactic
quirk: there is only one parameter, as the
calling object serves as the first operand. </p>

<p>+, -, <em>, /, = , etc. are all binary operators,
but the the calling object is the first operand;
the operator literally *is a member function</em>!</p>

<p>Ex: <code>account1 + account2</code></p>

<p>Here, <code>account1</code>, the calling object to the member
function operator <code>+</code> is the first operator,
and <code>account2</code> is the second operand. </p>

<p>Note that if we're not changing the calling
object (which is likely if we're returning a
<code>const</code> value), then the whole member function
should be a <em>const member function</em>. </p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<pre><code>class Account
{
    public:
        ...
        const Account operator +(const Account&amp; other) const;
        ...

    private:
        ...
};

    // The following implementation could be
    // in a separate file [indeed, where it should be]

// Here, the calling Account is "self" in a sense
// The other is called "other"
</code></pre>

<p>Don't get confused by the syntax:</p>

<p>Our return-type is a constant Account-type object.</p>

<p>We're overloading the <code>+</code>operator in the scope of
the Account class only.</p>

<p>We implicity consider the calling object to be the
first operand to this binary operator.</p>

<p>We pass the second operand (which also happens
to be of a class type) by reference for efficiency.</p>

<p>This member function operator overload promises
not to modify its calling object, denoted by the
<code>const</code> at the end of its declaration and the first
line of its definition. </p>

<pre><code>// Addition
const Account Account::operator +(const Account&amp; other) const; 
{
    double total = 0;

        // m_amt of the calling object
    total += m_amt;

        // As a non-member, this would have required
        // public accessor function
    total += other.m_amt; 

        // Create and return an anonymous object
    return Account(total);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Overloading operators as member functions is highly
advocated, as it follows the spirit of OOP--and avoids
the messiness of having a bunch of operator overload
declarations and definitions in the source file for main().</p>

<p>Imagine seeing all those for many different classes!</p>

<p>Here's another operator overload implemented as a member
function: </p>

<pre><code>// Subtraction
const Account Account::operator -(const Account&amp; other)
{
    double total = m_amt - other.m_amt;

    return Account(total);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The FCO, a.k.a, the <strong>function application operator</strong> (FAO),
can also be overloaded (which must be done as member function).</p>

<p>This will allow us to create objects that can act like
functions, known as <strong>function-objects</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class Multiplier 
{
    public:
        Multiplier(int m): multiplier(m) 
        { /* EMPTY */ }

        // Mulitiplier
        int operator()(int x) 
        { return multiplier * x; }
    private:
        int multiplier;
};

int main()
{
    // Create the multiplier (which has a base value)
    Multiplier base_mult(5);

    // Use the multiplier; prints out "20"
    cout &lt;&lt; base_mult(4) &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, a Multiplier class is created.
Its objects can be passed something to multiply
by. This could, of course, be extended to far
more complex cases. What differentiates this
from a normal function then? Why not create
a function <code>int base_mult(int number)</code>?</p>

<p>Because function-objects can save <strong>state</strong>. </p>

<p>For example, <code>base_mult</code> might multiply
by 1 more each time that it is invoked,
thanks to some internal counter that's implemented
as a private data member. This is far
better and cleaner than using static class
variables or--compiler forbid--global variables. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-overloading-the-assignment-operator---" class="anchor" href="#overloading-the-assignment-operator---" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overloading the Assignment Operator ( = )</h3>

<p>The assignment operator <code>=</code> is a special
overload that is integral to more complex
classes. </p>

<p>Say we have a object that already exists
(i.e. declared and initialized) and we want to 
set it to the value of another object that also already
exists. </p>

<p>In that case, we won't be using the copy constructor
but the assignment operator (=) instead. </p>

<p>Why is this? The copy constructor is a <em>constructor</em>:
it builds <em>new</em> class instances based on existing ones. </p>

<p>It's actually quite clever, taking an existing one as
an argument and then building a new one that is an
<em>independent clone</em> of the old one.</p>

<p>Still, changing an existing instance based on another
existing one is a useful operation, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>int g = 0; 
int f; 

f = g;
</code></pre>

<p>Defining our own assignment operator
is a necessity when we have a class
that dynamically allocates anything in memory. </p>

<p>See, like with the copy constructor, C++ defines
a default assignment operator for us if we don't 
have one explicitly defined. It'll do a shallow copy,
which is ineffective or even dangerous for anything
that uses the heap or system resources. </p>

<p>Instead, we'll overload the operator as a 
member function, which will allow us to handle all
the private variables that wouldn't be accessible 
to an operator overload outside of the class. </p>

<p>Overloading outside of the class means we would
have to implement everything with public member
functions only. </p>

<p>Friends are an exception.</p>

<p>An example of where an overloaded <code>=</code> is needed:</p>

<pre><code>Circ foo(1, 2, 3);
Circ bar(4, 5, 6);

bar = foo; 
</code></pre>

<p>Primitive types have this functionality built-in.
The old values are stomped over by the new ones. </p>

<p>Our new, programmer-defined types have to have their
own operations defined. We could have it do anything,
e.g. assign the old instances' values to the new. 
But we could launch a nuclear strike afterward too
if we wanted to. This would totally defy the typical
expectations of other developers though. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-syntax-1" class="anchor" href="#syntax-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Syntax</h4>

<p>Here's how to do so:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName&amp; operator=(const ClassName &amp;source)
{
    member1 = source.member1;
    member2 = source.member2;

    return (*this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The keyword <code>operator</code> which indicates that we're
redefining how an operator behaves.</p></li>
<li><p>We return a reference to an object of the class type.</p></li>
<li><p>The passed source object is passed by <em>constant</em> reference.</p></li>
<li><p>We return a reference to the changed destination object.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The assignment operator can be seen as a sort of 
.setEqualTo() member function for an object, which is why it
accepts only one operand here. </p>

<p>Why? The calling object is treated as the first operand. </p>

<p>We could use the new operator as <code>bar.operator=(foo)</code>,
but this would render the overloading operation pointless. 
Instead, we get the natural syntax we're used to: <code>bar = foo</code></p>

<p>Note: the use of <code>=</code> alone does not trigger the overloaded
operator. It's if it's an existing and an existing, rather
than a construction and an initialization, which would
be done with the copy constructor. </p>

<p>void f(Blah b)
{
    ...
}</p>

<pre><code>Blah b1; // Constructor

Blah b2(b1); // CC

Blah b3 = b1; // CC

b3 = b1; // Overloaded assignment

f(b3); // CC

<h4>
<a id="user-content-with-dynamic-memory" class="anchor" href="#with-dynamic-memory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>With Dynamic Memory</h4>

<p>When we have dynamic memory allocation with a class,
we'll need an overloaded assignment operator.</p>

<p>Here's what it'll have to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Free all dynamic memory currently used by the 
target/destination object/instance. 
(We can't afford to have a memory leak)</li>
</ol>

<p>What if the destination instances uses
MORE memory than what the source instance does!</p>

<p>We can't just copy over values, because then
we'd forget about the memory we never deallocated;
our tracking variables (if their values were copied
over from the source instance) wouldn't include them.</p>

<p>So we'd have a MEMORY LEAK.</p>

<p>Thus, DEALLOCATE existing memory before continuing.</p>

<p>Also, the destination instance's original values are
irrelevant, since we're gonna replace them. </p>

<p>Why was this not a problem with copy construction? 
Because we were creating a brand new object, 
which meant there was no memory previously allocated
for it. There's no memory to leak there, though both 
new and old will end up in invalid states if they
accidentally share the same memory.</p>

<p>In the PowerPoint, it should read that b is
destructed before a. It happens in reverse order
of creation. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allocate new memory (we need a new pointer to
a new section of memory, so as to not overlap
with the source instance; this is why we deallocated
our old memory) </p></li>
<li><p>Explicitly copy the contents of the source
instance to the destination/target instance. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Steps 2 &amp; 3 are basically what we did with
the copy constructor. </p>

<ol>
<li>Return a reference to the target instance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example continued:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName&amp; operator =(const ClassName &amp;source)
{
    member1 = source.member1;
    member2 = source.member2;

    delete member3;

    member3 = new _type;

    *member3 = source-&gt;member3; 

    return (*this);
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>Why should an overloaded assignment operator
free any dynamic memory currently used by a target class 
instance before allocating new memory and then copying 
over the contents of the source instance?</p>

<p>ANSWERED: See above after #1</p>

<hr>

<p>Can we explicitly call the destructor and the
copy constructor? Possible, apparently, but very
tricky, and would require a language feature
we don't know yet.</p>

<p>Also, deleting the existing members
then the calling the CC would compile,
but create another object, a temporary one,
which disappears immediately after the assignment
operator overload definition. </p>

<p>We will get to a technique that allows us
to pull this off. This allows us to avoid
the duplication of already existing code.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-multiple-assignments" class="anchor" href="#multiple-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multiple Assignments</h4>

<p>The reason we <code>return (*this)</code> is so that we
can do something like the following: </p>

<pre><code>// class Foo has already been declared
// and implemented elsewhere,
// and stores a single unsigned int

Foo first(3), second(4), third(6);

first = second = third;
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> will have <code>third</code>'s value of 6. </p>

<p>How does this work? The assignment operator
in C++ has a <em>right-to-left associativity</em>,
meaning we move right to left. </p>

<p><code>second</code> is set to <code>third</code>'s value.</p>

<p>The result of this is a modified <code>second</code>, 
which is returned from the (=) operator function,
and used for setting the value of <code>first</code>.</p>

<p>So the expression looks like this as it progresses:</p>

<pre><code>first = second = third;

first = second; // second has third's value(s)

first;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>return (*this)</code> line is an example of a member function
of a variable returning the whole variable!</p>

<p>Assignment is actually returning a value, the new
value of the lvalue on the rightmost binary assignment:</p>

<pre><code>x = n = k;

x = (n = k); // Parantheses not needed

x = (n) // n has k's value
</code></pre>

<p>It's relay of values from right to left. </p>

<hr>

<p>N.B.: <code>this</code> is a <em>pointer</em> to the calling object;
we dereference it in order to do anything with it.</p>

<p>We follow the <code>this</code> pointer to the calling
object, and then return a reference to it. </p>

<p>We could return a copy, but this is wasteful. 
Pass on the modified paper rather than a copy of it.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-anti-aliasing-of-instances" class="anchor" href="#anti-aliasing-of-instances" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Anti-Aliasing of Instances</h4>

<p>There's one problem with our assignment operator
as-is: what if it's invoked upon an object (that
has dynamically-allocated memory in use) to set
it equal to itself?</p>

<p>E.g. <code>x = x</code></p>

<p>"If you don't want to do anything, just write
an empty statement, semicolon."</p>

<p>But we do assign objects to themselves; this
happens when we have a function that takes
arguments and we pass the same objects to it.</p>

<p>It may happen accidentally when stuff nests 
deeply. </p>

<p>This is known as <strong>aliasing</strong>, when two different
references/pointers lead to the same thing, which can
cause unintended issues. </p>

<p>We'll have a problem. As is, it will deallocate, 
then re-allocate, then copy over uninitialized junk
data over itself. <em>We'll have lost our original data</em>,
which can lead to all sorts of unintended consequences.  </p>

<p>The solution is simple: <em>check for self-assignment</em>:</p>

<p>(Our code is valid for when the operator is called
on two different objects) </p>

<p>"The one thing that distinguishes one object from
another is if they're in the same place in memory." </p>

<p>Analogy: Where are persons A and B? They're in the same
place in space-time? Same person. Different places? 
Different persons. </p>

<pre><code>ClassName&amp; operator=(ClassName &amp;source)
{
    if (this == &amp;source) 
        // Source is passed by reference; 
        // we need to compare addresses 
    {
        return (*this); // No changes made
    } 
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why return right away? Assignment's goal
is to make the lvalue a clone of the rvalue.
If they're the same instance, this is already
true. Just return the instance. </p>

<p>The following is NOT a correct check:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName&amp; operator=(ClassName &amp;source)
{
    if (*this == source)
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Because what if the source instance just happens
to have the same value(s) as the target instance, but
<em>is</em> a separate, <em>distinct</em> instance? This
doesn't actually check if source and target are 
the same instance; it's actually
checking if they're equivalent instances. </p>

<p>The first check does, as it's <em>comparing memory addresses</em>,
not values.</p>

<p>This also lets us avoid worrying about overloading
the <code>==</code> operator as well (and we'd have to do manual
checking member by member within the overloading definition
for <code>==</code>, we might never realize our mistake unless we had
a class with pointer members and we compared addresses 
instead of values [perhaps by mistake] and realized that
that was it exactly what we needed). </p>

<p>Instead, here we simply compare memory addresses;
different objects should be not at the same place
in memory, unless things have gotten really screwed up. </p>

<p>Aliasing comes up in many places. Any time
we have <em>a function that takes references or pointers</em>
to <em>objects of the same type</em>, we need to check if they're
pointing to the same instance, which is something
that can come up unintentionally deep in some algorithm.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>void transfer(Account&amp; from, Account&amp; to, double amt)
{
    from.debit(amt):
    to.credit(amt);
}

transfer(arr[i], arr[j], 2000);
</code></pre>

<p>What if i and j are equal? We must account
for any situation where we might be acting upon
the same object. This one would have no net effect:
it loses 2000, then loses 2000. BUT, a change in requirements
later on may change our implementation and if we forget
about this harmless aliasing issue, then it can turn harmful.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ...
    if (amt &gt;= 10000)
        fileForm(...);
</code></pre>

<p>Filing unnecessary forms has consequences. What happens
if we transfer money from an account to itself
then we filed a form for no reason, bringing down
the legal consequences. </p>

<p>So, check for aliasing: </p>

<pre><code>{
    ...
    if (&amp;from == &amp;to)
        return;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is something that should be handled at design time,
after we've designed the functions' interfaces in specs.
We need to determine what we should do in some case,
e.g. with aliasing. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-story-time" class="anchor" href="#story-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Story Time</h5>

<p>This happened with an AI researcher where his dissertation
was a program that discovered mathematical theorems.
He gave it guiding principles (look for stuff that
occurs rarely or frequently) and and got it to try to prove
theorems, and had it identify interesting things. </p>

<p>The program discovered that numbers have factors,
then examined those and eventually prime numbers. </p>

<p>He got hired by a project commissioned by the Navy,
where they set up a game to discover interesting tactics. </p>

<p>In the simulation, one thing that occured would be
to fire one missile from one ship to another ship.</p>

<p>So the program found a situation where firing a missile
on itself was useful: if the enemy ship fired on itself
(at the same time that we fired on it), it would sink faster!
The function didn't account for the aliasing contingency. </p>

<hr>

<p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>Does this overloaded assignment operator work even
when we have nested classes that all use dynamic memory?</p>

<p>Possible self-answer: </p>

<p>Yes, if it correctly handles the class data member
value transfers correctly.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-swapping-objects" class="anchor" href="#swapping-objects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Swapping Objects</h4>

<p>As we learned before, we can't just 
directly exchange variables (a = b; b = a).
We'll lose one variable's values otherwise.</p>

<p>Instead, we need a temporary clone to allow us
to transfer values. It's like Hanoi Towers! </p>

<p>This is trivial once we have our copy 
constructors and assignment operators. This
is slow though, with all sorts of allocation
and deallocation happening. </p>

<p>What if we just swapped the data members
and pointers (to objects) instead? We can do that! 
(Again, we'll need the 3-step temporary
copy value transfer method).</p>

<p>This swap() function would have to be
a member function of the class in order
to work, but this would be blazing fast!</p>

<p>The temporary variables should be automatic variables.</p>

<p>Things get complicated once we have classes
within classes though...</p>

<a id="user-content-avoiding-code-duplication" class="anchor" href="#avoiding-code-duplication" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Avoiding Code Duplication</h4>

<p>Wait, this is how we can avoid having to do
all that work with code that basically 
duplicates the destructor and copy constructor!</p>

<p>THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE BUT COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT!</p>

<pre><code>ClassName&amp; ClassName::operator=(const ClassName&amp; source)
{
    if (this != &amp;source)
    {
        ClassName temp(source); // We use the CC

            // Remember the goal of assignment
            // Swap variables using a temporary value

            // The below is equivalent to this.swap(temp)
            // Remember that class methods implicitly point
            // the `this` pointere to the calling object instance

        swap(temp); // Where calling object is destination
    }
            // Temp is destructed; its scope was inside that
            // `if` conditional block
            // We avoiding duplicating the destructor

    return *this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is so much simpler! What Smallberg just showed
us is the <strong>copy-and-swap</strong> style in modern C++ (late 90s onward).</p>

<p>Just make swap() work well!</p>

<p>Also, we don't have to check for self-assignment, the code
would still work, as we'd be copying to a temporary,
swapping values, and the original would just get its original
values back. This is fucking awesome!</p>

<p>Summary of the two approaches: </p>

<p>Traditional assignment operator implementation: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Deallocate all dynamically allocated memory currently used
by the calling instance. </p></li>
<li><p>Allocate enough memory to hold the source's contents. </p></li>
<li><p>Copy over the memory contents of the source instance
to our newly allocated memory</p></li>
<li><p>Return a reference to the calling instance</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Copy-and-swap approach: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a temporary copy of the source instance using 
the copy constructor. </p></li>
<li><p>Swap the temporary copy's values with our calling
instance's value. This entails swapping variable values, 
including pointers to objects, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Return a reference to the calling instance. The temporary 
copy went out of scope and was destructed automatically.
We avoid code duplication and unnecessary overhead. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The book notes that </p>

<pre><code>"The copy constructor, the = assignment operator,

experts say that if you need any of them, you need all three."
(p. 464)
</code></pre>

<p>Why would we need all three? If we have a destructor,
then we likely have something allocated dynamically,
which means that new copies made from old, existing
variables will have to be properly initialized with
a copy constructor, and existing variables being set
to the value of another existing variable will require
an overloaded assignment operator (=). </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-initializer-lists-1" class="anchor" href="#initializer-lists-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initializer Lists</h3>

<p>Say we have class: </p>

<pre><code>class Test
{
    public: 

        Test(int number, string name)
        {
            m_member1 = number;
            m_member2 = name;
        }

        int getMember();
        bool isEmpty();

    private:

        int m_member1;
        string m_member2;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, when we construct a new instance
of the class, say <code>Test t1</code>, then the 
<em>data members</em> of the class are declared <em>before</em>
any code in our defined constructor is executed.</p>

<p>This can be seen as:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    ...
    int m_member1;
    string m_member1;

    m_member1 = number;
    m_member2 = name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, a normal constructor that assigns
passed arguments' values to data members is like
declaring the members and then assigning them.</p>

<p>To get the equivalent of initialization at
instantiation, we need an <em>initializer list</em>.
This will pre-empt any default constructors 
for data members of other class-types as well.</p>

<p>We need this for when other classes don't
have a default constructor and need arguments
passed to them, or we want to customize our 
new object at creation. This also improves
performance, as we're avoiding the extra step that
comes from declaring <em>then</em> assigning. Instead,
we do it all in one step. </p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName(_parameters)
    : member1(parameter1), member2(parameter2), ...
{
    // CONSTRUCTOR BODY
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR:</p>

<pre><code>// Initialization list style
  Survivor::Survivor ():
      m_name("Rick Grimes"),
      m_infected(false),
      m_health(100),
      m_gun(Weapon("Beretta", 30)) 
      {}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul>
<li>No semicolon after initializer list</li>
<li>Initializer lists will initialize members
in the order in which they are listed in the
class definition, <em>regardless</em> of their order
in the initialization list</li>
<li>Curly braces must still follow for the constructor
definition, even if it is an empty <code>{}</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Initializer lists</strong> are the only way to initialize 
<code>constant</code> data members</li>
</ul>

<p>So the rule of thumb is this: 
use an initializer list whenever possible,
and it is especially preferable for 
non-primitive types. </p>

<p>Compiling a C++ program is actually 
a multi-step process: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preprocessing </p></li>
<li><p>Compilation [Optimization thrown in here as well]</p></li>
<li><p>Linking</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And we end up with an executable file.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-preprocessing" class="anchor" href="#preprocessing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preprocessing</h4>

<p>Preprocessing deals with <em>preprocessor directives</em>
like <code>#include</code> and <code>#define</code>. The <code>#</code> indicates
a preprocessor directive. </p>

<p><code>#include</code> replaces the file name with the file
contents (or at least the identifiers for later resolution). </p>

<p><code>#define</code> works before compilation,
and replaces a defined identifier in code with whatever
literal we associated with it. </p>

<pre><code>#define LOUD_STRING "YELLING"
#define COOL_INT 42

int main ()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; LOUD_STRING &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; COOL_INT &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What's the difference between <code>const</code> and <code>#define</code>?
The former obeys scope rules; the latter will be
applied globally, even across files (how else
would include guards work?). Note then that <code>#define</code>
should NOT be used for any sort of variable that
needs to be changed throughout the course of a program. </p>

<p>Note also the preprocessed nature of <code>#define</code> means
that we won't take up memory needed for another variable,
which usually shouldn't be something we need to worry about.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-compilation" class="anchor" href="#compilation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compilation</h4>

<p>Now, compilation occurs (which really encompasses
the use of an assembler as well, where we go from 
C++ source code to assembly code to machine code [binary]).</p>

<p>Each source code file is transformed into an <em>object file</em> 
of machine code. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-linking" class="anchor" href="#linking" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linking</h4>

<p>The <em>linker</em> follows, checking that for every declaration, 
we have a definition. We should never hit anything in code
and go "Wait, what's that?". All the appropriate dependencies
will then be grouped together and made into an executable file.  </p>

<p>[At Smallberg's lecture, which replaced
a standard Friday discussion]</p>

<p>Up until now, we've dealt with language 
issues, e.g. when default 'structors and
operators need to be replaced with our own
custom definitions. </p>

<p>Review: </p>

<pre><code>class Blah
{
    public: 

        Blah(const Blah&amp; other);
            // No other constructors declared
        ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anything interesting about this class?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answer: <em>It's impossible to create a Blah object.</em>
Here, we can only create a Blah as a copy of another
Blah. It's chicken and the egg, but with no resolution. 
It's an infinite regression toward nothing. </p>

<p>Can't we do <code>Blah b2(b1)</code>? NO. </p>

<p>"This class is useless!--not this class, CS 32."</p>

<p>Rules: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A default constructor is provided <em>only</em> when we 
do not declare <em>any</em> constructors for a class 
(including copy constructors).</p></li>
<li><p>A default copy constructor is provided only when we
do not declare a copy constructor.</p></li>
<li><p>A default destructor is provided only when we do not
declare a destructor (which would call the destructors
of other classes for any data members of those class types).
It does nothing for primitive types, however, e.g. a
pointer to a dynamically allocated Zombie pointer. </p></li>
<li><p>If we do not declare an assignment operator for a class,
the compiler will provide one for us. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This sounds like Miranda Rights for classes, haha. 
"If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you."</p>

<p>Anytime a class of ours contains a low-level resource
handle (e.g. a pointer to something dynamically allocated), 
we're gonna need the Big Three: destructor, copy constructor, 
assignment operator. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if our class is built out of other 
class types that are already encapsulated and self-cleaning,
then we don't need to worry about our class's 'structors
and operators. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h4>

<p>It's time for our first major data structure!</p>

<p>Let's say we have a collection of objects,
and we wanna do stuff with it. </p>

<p>What are our options for doing so?</p>

<p>Originally, our only option for grouping
together like things was a fixed-sized array.</p>

<p>Smallberg just proposed an array that layed out
its elements throughout its indices. Say we had
a group of names represented as std::string's. </p>

<p>We quickly find that inserting, deleting, sorting,
etc. objects is very annoying.</p>

<p>Someone finally answered "Put them all at one end
of the array.". Someone else also suggested having a
counter for the number of the names. Now, that counter
is also the index of the next available element. 
We don't have to search for an available slot before 
adding an item. Searching is also not bad: we can stop
once we know that we've reached the end of the array.</p>

<p>Here's the annoying one: deleting an item. We could
replace it with the empty string, but that would 
throw off the counter. Deleting is made easy,
but complicates other common collection-related
operations. This also assumes that an empty string
is not important for representing something. It'd be
like excluding 3 from the set of all real numbers
for no real reason.</p>

<p>So instead, we want to make sure that the array
is always containing stuff we care about in the early 
part of it. We can shift everything over, which is
needed if order matters. If order does <em>not</em> matter,
than we can just take the last item and replace the
deleted one with that, then decrement the counter. If
the deleted item was at the end, we can just decrement
the counter.</p>

<p>Note though that finding an item takes time,
and preserving order is annoying. And of course,
the major downside is that we're limited in size. </p>

<p>What if we did know the max size needed?  </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-a-house-analogy" class="anchor" href="#a-house-analogy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A House Analogy</h4>

<p>Einstein expects a large shipment of animals
but will rent houses one at a time, keeping
track only of the last-rented house, and in
each house, he'll note on the fridge where the next 
rented house is. The last note will say "end of list". </p>

<p>This is necessary because he doesn't know in advance
how many he'll need.</p>

<p>His algo: </p>

<ol>
<li>Rent a new empty house</li>
<li>Put his animal in the empty house</li>
<li>Note where the next house in the list is</li>
<li>Update his chalk board to know where his
last-rented house is</li>
</ol>

<p>Do it with a struct to represent houses: </p>

<pre><code>struct House
{
    string name; // animal we're holding
    House *next; // address of next house
};
</code></pre>

<p>Outside of the struct, we'll have a special
last-rented pointer to know where the last
house is.</p>

<p>The last house identifies as the last one
in the list via <code>nullptr</code> for its fridge note
to the next house: there is no next house. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-a-train-analogy" class="anchor" href="#a-train-analogy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Train Analogy</h4>

<p>[The following are notes written
before, during, and after Lecture 6]</p>

<p>Picture a train. Its cars are linked together.
Each car knows what the next car is. </p>

<p>If we start with knowledge of what the
first car is, and mark the last car (the caboose)
as such (some sort of marker to let us know
that we've reached the end of the train), then
we can just start at the beginning and go from 
car to car until we hit the caboose.</p>

<p>This knowledge of the first pointer is known
as the head pointer. Each train car can
be a class or struct-type object, containing its
data members as well as a pointer to the next
car. This next pointer is how we know where to go,
well, next!</p>

<p>In code, this will look something like this: </p>

<p>// Items in a linked list are called <strong>nodes</strong></p>

<pre><code>// The container for our nodes and their data
struct Car
{
    std::string m_name;
    Car* m_next; 

    // Note: a class cannot have a data member
    // of its own type; that'd be weirdly recursive
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is not a pointer to itself, but a reference
to another Car. </p>

<p>This is a <strong>self-referential data-type</strong>. </p>

<p>To make things easy, the linked list itself
will be held in a class. Here's the sort of 
stuff we can do with it:</p>

<p>Also, the node struct is easily defined
in another header file elsewhere or done
as a private member of the containing class.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;

// A container for our linked list
class Train 
{
    public: 

        // Create a new linked list Train
        Train();

        // Dive-bomb the current Train
        ~Train()

        // Add nodes/Cars to the Train
        void addCarFront(const std::string&amp; name);
        void addCarMiddle(const std::string&amp; name);
        void addCarRead(const std::string&amp; name);

            // Each of these addNode() functions
            // will have different implementations
            // in order to work correctly!

        // Delete an individual Car, based
        // on its characteristics or its 
        // position in the Train
        void deleteCar(const std::string&amp; name);
        void deleteCar(const int&amp; slotNumber):

        // Find the position of a node
        int findCar(const std::string&amp; name) const;

        // Process the list
        // This could mean doing stuff
        // with node data, ordering nodes
        // (e.g. alphabetizing), etc.
        void print carsList() const;


    private:

        int m_numCars;
        Car* m_headCar; // The head pointer
};
</code></pre>

<p>To know when we've hit the last <em>node</em> in a
linked list, the last node will have a next
pointer that points to <code>nullptr</code>. This means
that it's not meant to go anywhere next,
and so we know that we've reached the end of
the linked list. </p>

<p>Note that EVERY linked list must have at least
a head pointer (if we reversed head and tail,
then we could really call the "tail" the new head).</p>

<p>We won't know where to start with the linked list otherwise. 
We have to have able to start at the head and follow
next pointers to the next node till we've reached the end.</p>

<p>See, that's the only thing linking everything together:
the pointers. The addNode() methods are just dynamically
allocating new nodes in memory. We don't have an array
of nodes (that'd be dumb; we'd be dealing with the limitations
of arrays then, something we probably wanted to avoid by
using a linked list). </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-initialization" class="anchor" href="#initialization" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initialization</h4>

<p>Initialization of a linked list 
is a <em>necessity</em>. The last thing we want
to do is accidentally follow a head pointer
to what we believe is the start of a linked
list only to discover (perhaps very belatedly)
that it was a dangling pointer. </p>

<p>This happens with the containing class' constructor. </p>

<pre><code>Train()
{
    m_head = nullptr; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the head pointer is set to the nullptr,
we know that the linked list is <em>empty</em>. 
A list is empty at creation, so have the constructor
set the head pointer to <code>nullptr</code>. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-insertion" class="anchor" href="#insertion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Insertion</h4>

<p>Cool, now let's add some nodes! </p>

<p>Note that we can add nodes to
the top, middle, or bototm. </p>

<p>Adding to the top is easiest and fastest
when compared to the other two. Always
try to choose the simplest one that best
suits our goal. Work smart, not hard. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-at-the-top" class="anchor" href="#at-the-top" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>At the Top</h5>

<p>Adding to the top has
two possible cases.</p>

<ol>
<li>The linked list already has nodes in it.</li>
<li>The linked list is empty. </li>
</ol>

<p>Reminder of the node struct:</p>

<pre><code>struct Car
{
    std::string m_name; 
    Car* m_next;
};
</code></pre>

<p>To add a new node: </p>

<pre><code>void addCarFront(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    // Create a new Car
    Car* latest = new Car; 

    // Customize the Car
    latest-&gt;m_name = name; 

    // Link new top node to what
    // was previously the top node,
    // which is given by the head pointer

    latest-&gt;m_next = m_head; 
        // m_head is part of Train

    // Update the head pointer to point
    // to the new top of the list
    m_head = latest; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will work even if the list is empty!</p>

<p>Without comments:</p>

<pre><code>void addCarFront(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    Car *latest = new Car; 
    latest-&gt;m_name = name; 

    latest-&gt;m_next = m_head; 
    m_head = latest; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The general algo: </p>

<ol>
<li>Allocate memory</li>
<li>Initialize the node</li>
<li>Link the node to the former start of the lsit</li>
<li>Re-aim the head pointer at the new node</li>
</ol>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-at-the-end" class="anchor" href="#at-the-end" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>At the End</h5>

<p>If we're adding nodes to the end of a list,
we must again consider if it is empty or
filled (perhaps partially). </p>

<pre><code>void addCarRear(const std::string&amp; name)
{
</code></pre>

<p>In the empty case, things are easy:
we can just consider it to be adding
to the top of an empty linked list!
There is no beginning or end, so make
the Beginning:</p>

<pre><code>    if (m_head == nullptr)
        addCarFront(name);
</code></pre>

<p>If the list already has nodes, 
then we need to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the links to the current last node</li>
<li>Allocate a new node using <code>new</code>
</li>
<li>Add data to the new node</li>
<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer in the new node to <code>nullptr</code> </li>
<li>Update the former last node to point to the new last node</li>
</ol>

<p>The hard part is following those links, something
called <strong>list traversal</strong>.</p>

<p>We're gonna use a loop to go from node to node:</p>

<pre><code>Car* temp; 
temp = m_head; 
// Point to 1st node, thanks to head pointer; start at top of list

while (temp-&gt;next != nullptr) // Go till we hit the current last node
{
    temp = temp-&gt;next; 
    // This changes temp to point to the next node
    // We CANNOT use temp++ (we're not in an array)
    // This means temp will now point to the next node
};
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of linked lists means we can jump around in memory,
thanks to pointers. If we had kept a counter of the number
of nodes, we could use a for-loop. This current loop
could be used to count the number of items in the list.</p>

<p>An alternative loop syntax (as shown by Smallberg in video lecture):</p>

<pre><code>for (Car *temp = m_head; temp-&gt;next != nullptr; temp = temp-&gt;next)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is not useful for this function,
as the temp variable will go out of scope and 
disappear. Instead, the first syntax is better here.
The second one is best for, say, a print() function.</p>

<p>We could resolve this by declaring <code>temp</code> before the for-loop.</p>

<p>Once we hit the last node: </p>

<pre><code>Car *latest = new Car; 

latest-&gt;name = name;
latest-&gt;next = nullptr; // This is the new latest node!

temp-&gt;next = latest; 
// Access the next pointer of the old last node 
// Have it point to our new last node
</code></pre>

<p>Full version of adding a node to the end: </p>

<pre><code>void addCarRear(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    // If list is empty, just treat it as adding to the front
    if (m_head == nullptr)
        addCarFront(name);

    // Otherwise, traverse list to last node
    Car *temp = m_head; // Start at top of linked list

    // Keep going till next pointer shows nullptr;
    // This marks the last node as the end
    while(temp-&gt;next != nullptr)
    {
        temp = temp-&gt;next; // Follow next pointer to next node
    }

    // Found last item if here in the code
    // Create new node
    Car *latest = new Car;

    // Customize latest Car and mark it as being the end
    latest-&gt;name = name;
    latest-&gt;next = nullptr;

    // Link old last node to new last node
    temp-&gt;next = latest;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without comments:</p>

<pre><code>void addCarRear(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    if (m_head == nullptr)
        addCarFront(name);

    Car *temp = m_head; // Start at top of linked list

    while(temp-&gt;next != nullptr)
    {
        temp = temp-&gt;next; // Follow next pointer to next node
    }

    Car *latest = new Car;

    latest-&gt;name = name;
    latest-&gt;next = nullptr;

    temp-&gt;next = latest;
}
</code></pre>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-in-the-middle" class="anchor" href="#in-the-middle" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In the Middle</h5>

<p>Inserting in the middle comes up when we have an ordered link list,
e.g. an alphabetized one and insertions need to happen at the right
spots. </p>

<p>The basic algorithm in pseudocode is this: </p>

<pre><code>void addCarMiddle(std::string&amp; name)

        addCarFront(name);
    }

    {
        // This happens if the new item is smaller than
        // earlier in the alphabet, etc.
        addCarFront(name);
    }
    else if (new node belongs somewhere in the list)
    {
        // Traverse list till we find node just ABOVE
        // the proper spot

        // Create the node

        // Link the node into position right AFTER the
        // the node ABOVE its proper position
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In actual code: </p>

<pre><code>void addCarMiddle(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    // List is empty: new node belongs at top
    if (m_head == nullptr)
    {
        addCarFront(name);
    }
    else if ( // Item belongs at top of list )
    {
        addCarFront(name);
    }
    // Item belongs somewhere in list
    else
    {
        // Traverse list to find node above insertion point
        // Start with head pointer to top of list

        Car *above = m_head;

        // Keep going; last possible place we can go to
        // is last node; if we go there, the new item
        // belongs at the end; use addCarRear() for that

        while (above-&gt;next != nullptr)
        {
            // Code to see if we've found the node
            // just above where our new node should be

            above = above-&gt;next; // Move down a node
        }

        // Allocate and customize new node

        Car *latest = new Car; 
        latest-&gt;name = name;

        // Link new node to the one below and the one above

        // Link to node after new node (the old next node)
        // This MUST be done first, or we lose track
        // of the rest of the list

        latest-&gt;next = above-&gt;next; 

        // Link to above node

        above-&gt;next = latest;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<a id="user-content-processing" class="anchor" href="#processing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Processing</h4>

<p>To do stuff with a linked list, 
we traverse through it and do
whatever we'd like to do with it, 
e.g. print out its contents,
compute an average, etc. </p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>void printCarsList() const
{
    // Print every item
    // nullptr lets us know we're
    // at the last one

    Car* temp = m_head;
    while (temp-&gt;next != nullptr)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; temp-&gt;name &lt;&lt; endl;

        // Don't forget to increment!
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-destruction" class="anchor" href="#destruction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Destruction</h4>

<p>Now for that destructor!</p>

<p>Every node has something dynamically allocated,
so <code>delete</code> needs to be rained down upon all of them. </p>

<p>We cannot just do this as part of a normal
traversal though; we'd delete the temp each otherwise,
and we'd lost the rest of the list.</p>

<p>Instead, we'll have two temporary pointers,
just as we did with a deletion operation on a single
item: one to point to the doomed node, one to point
to the one right after it. We simply shift both along. </p>

<pre><code>~Train()
{
    Car* temp = m_head;
    Car* nextOne;

    while (temp != nullptr)
    {
        nextOne = temp-&gt;next;
        delete temp;
        temp = nextOne;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the last run, nextOne will point
to <code>nullptr</code>, the node temp points to
will be deleted, and temp will be set to 
<code>nullptr</code>, thus meeting the loop-terminating condition. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-tail-pointers" class="anchor" href="#tail-pointers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tail Pointers</h4>

<p>We have a head pointer that points to the start
of a linked list; why not have one that points
to the end (tail) of one as well!</p>

<p>This will greatly speed up some of our operations. </p>

<p>Updating our previous code: </p>

<pre><code>class Train
{
    ...

    private:

        Car* m_head;
        Car* m_tail;
};

void addCarRear(const std::string&amp; name)
{
    if (m_head == nullptr)
        addCarFront(name);
</code></pre>

<p>addCarFront() will need to be updated
to support adjusting the tail poitner as necessary. </p>

<pre><code>    Car *temp = m_head; // Start at top of linked list

    while(temp-&gt;next != nullptr)
    {
        temp = temp-&gt;next; // Follow next pointer to next node
    }

    Car *latest = new Car;

    latest-&gt;name = name;
    latest-&gt;next = nullptr;

    // Link old last node to new last node
    m_tail-&gt;next = latest; 

    // Update tail pointer to point to new last node
    m_tail = latest; 
}
</code></pre>

<a id="user-content-doubly-linked-lists" class="anchor" href="#doubly-linked-lists" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Doubly-Linked Lists</h3>

<p>In a doubly-linked list, every
node has next AND previous pointers. </p>

<pre><code>struct Car
{
    Car* p_next;
    Car* p_prev;
}; 
</code></pre>

<p>The first node's <code>previous</code> must point
to <code>nullptr</code>. The last node's <code>next</code> must point
to <code>nullptr</code>.</p>

<p>Head and tail pointers are usable with a doubly-linked
list. Moving up and down is now very easy.</p>

<p>Now, the implementations of all of our member functions
for the containing class change. With each insertion,
deletion, etc., we'll need to update:</p>

<ol>
<li>The new node's <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code> pointers. </li>
<li>The preceding node's <code>next</code> pointer</li>
<li>The following node's <code>previous</code> pointer</li>
</ol>

<a id="user-content-linked-lists-cheat-sheet" class="anchor" href="#linked-lists-cheat-sheet" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linked Lists Cheat Sheet</h3>

<p>Keep in mind: NEVER access a node
until the pointer to it has been validated
as a valid one. <code>delete</code> on a <code>nullptr</code> has no
effect, but dereferencing it is undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>if (ptr != nullptr)
    // Access node data
</code></pre>

<p>Advance ptr: </p>

<pre><code>if (ptr != nullptr)
    ptr = ptr-&gt;next;
</code></pre>

<p>See if ptr points to the last node in a list:</p>

<pre><code>if (ptr != nullptr &amp;&amp; ptr-&gt;next == nullptr)
    // ptr points to last node
</code></pre>

<p>To get the next node's data:</p>

<pre><code>if (ptr != nullptr &amp;&amp; ptr-&gt;next != nullptr)
    // Access next node's data
</code></pre>

<p>To get head node data:</p>

<pre><code>if (m_head != nullptr)
    // Access m_head-&gt;blah
</code></pre>

<p>To check if a list is empty:</p>

<pre><code>if (m_head == nullptr)
    // List is empty
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we have two classes or structs:
one for the nodes, one for the linked list. 
It's easier if a struct is used for the nodes,
but these are kept in the private part of
the containing class. Also, tail &amp; head
pointers can be supplemented with a counter
for the number of objects in the linked
list.</p>

<p>Accessing an item in an array is faster;

<p>However, they also take far more effort

<a id="user-content-inheritance" class="anchor" href="#inheritance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inheritance</h3>

<p>We are blasting forward, and fast! </p>

<p>Inheritance is the idea of forming
new classes using ones that have already
been defined. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-shieldedrobot--student-analogies" class="anchor" href="#shieldedrobot--student-analogies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ShieldedRobot &amp; Student Analogies</h3>

<p>Consider of a newly-sentient
being of type Robot. </p>

<p>Side-lecture: </p>

<p>"Do you want to be a passive consumer
or someone who creates stuff that makes
the world a better place?"</p>

<p>Carey is having that midlife crisis
now, haha. </p>

<p>"Otherwise, you'll have an empty life."</p>

<p>Now consider a very similar Robot
that also has a shield, so we'd have a 
ShieldedRobot. </p>

<p>Note that its members are all very similar
and we would waste time recreating all that. </p>

<p>The only difference here is the shield. 
Essentially, a ShieldedRobot is a Robot
with some additional methods/data. </p>

<p>Another example: a Person and a Student.
A Student is a Person--but with a GPA and an ID. </p>

<p><strong>Never duplicate code</strong>. That introduces
the possibility of more bugs, and also wastes time. </p>

<p>So we'll define a <strong>subclass</strong> (ShieldedRobot) and have it
<strong>inherit</strong> (reuse) the functions and data
of a <strong>superclass</strong>. (Robot)</p>

<p>Then, the subclass has the new methods/data, known 
as <strong>specialization</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>class ShieldedRobot "is a kind of" Robot
{
    // Has all the Robot stuff
    // PLUS:

    /// Shield stuff
}
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-terminology" class="anchor" href="#terminology" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Terminology</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Define the superclass</p></li>
<li><p>Define the subclass, based on the superclass,
adding any new stuff as needed</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A ShieldedRobot will have all the Robot
methods and data too; C++ determines automatically
which function to call. We can overload inside
the subclass.</p>

<p>Anytime we have a relationship,
"A is a type of B", <em>inheritance</em> may be warranted. </p>

<p>In contrast, a Name is part of a Person.
So a Name would be a member of Person. </p>

<p>BUT, a Person is derived from Animal.</p>

<p>We can inherit many, many times:
A CSNerd is a Person is a Mammal is an Animal.</p>

<p>So each specialization is a "Blah" with "additional".</p>

<p>The superclass is also called a <strong>base class</strong>. 
The subclass is also called a <strong>derived class</strong>.</p>

<p>A class can be a derived class of some
other class, but also a base class for other 
classes. E.g., Mammal is a subclass of Animal
but a superclass for Person, Monkey, etc. as well. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-syntax-2" class="anchor" href="#syntax-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Syntax</h4>

<pre><code>class ShieldedRobot : public Robot
</code></pre>

<p>This says that a ShieldedRobot
publicly acknowledges that it is a subclass
of a Robot. There is such a thing as
private inheritance, but is usually not needed;
it basically makes it a member. Just use
class composition instead. </p>

<p>This is <em>public inheritance</em>. </p>

<p>What if a subclass doesn't need a superclass'
functionality? We'll have to design around
that, e.g. render the askOutOnaDate()
function of CSNerd an empty one. The Person
does that, not the CSNerd. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-virtual-member-functions" class="anchor" href="#virtual-member-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual Member Functions</h3>

<p>A derived class can also <em>override</em> the existing
functions from the base class. </p>

<p>Student: "Go Bruins!"
NerdyStudent: "I love circuits!"</p>

<p>What if the derived class' function had a different
function signature? Then it's not the same function,
and this isn't overriding. </p>

<p>But if we are overriding, put the <strong>virtual</strong>
keywords in front of both the base class
and the derived class functions (the original
and the replacement). It is technically only needed
in the base class, but good style has it in front
of both. </p>

<p>If a NerdyStudent has its own member variables,
then it must have its own constructor,
initializing only the stuff</p>

<p>If no override, the subclass will use the superclass'
version of the function, e.g. the StudlyStudent will 
say "Go Bruins" too, but the <strong>virtual</strong> will be needed
in Student if NerdyStudent still redefines the catchPhrase() 
function. Put the virtual at the highest level.</p>

<pre><code>class DerivedClass : public SuperClass
{
    public:

        virtual bool catchPhrase();

}
</code></pre>

<p>What happens if <code>virtual</code> is placed in front of all
the base class? It will slow down the program. </p>

<p>If the member functions are defined outside the class,
only put <code>virtual</code> within the class definition. 
Putting it outside of the class decl's is not allowed, </p>

<pre><code>void NerdyStudent::catchPhrase()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "I love circuits!" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If it's inlined inside the subclass, have <code>virtual</code>
in the superclass and the subclass. </p>

<p>ONLY use <code>virtual</code> for functions that we want
to override/redefine. It will only slow down the program
otherwise, though that will NOT produce errors. </p>

<p>Again, <code>virtual</code> is TECHNICALLY ONLY needed in the subclass. </p>

<p>What if we had Robot -&gt; ComedianRobot -&gt; ReallyBadComedianRobot</p>

<p>Where would virtual be needed? Best pratice: in all 3,
EVEN IF only ReallyBadComedianRobot redefined the catchPhrase() 
function.</p>

<p>Can we have inherit from two classes at once? YES!</p>

<pre><code>class ComedianRobot : public Robot, public Comedian
</code></pre>

<p>Java can't do it, but C++ can, but it is generally
frowned upon. </p>

<p>What if inherited from two classes, but both
have redefined talk() functions? Which one is
used? Office hours! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-inheritance-function-call-rules" class="anchor" href="#inheritance-function-call-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inheritance Function Call Rules</h4>

<p>Examples: Student and NerdyStudent.</p>

<p>The NerdyStudent has a virtual cheer() member funiton.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>IF you define a function in the base class
<em>and</em> redefine in the derived class then the derived version of the 
function will <em>hide</em> the base clas version of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Any public functions defined in the base class,
but <em>not redefined</em> in a derived class can be called
normally by all parts of our program. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that virtual member functions may call
the superclass' member functions too BUT:</p>

<ol>
<li>IF your code wants to call a function in the base class
that's been redefined in the derived class,
it must use a class:: prefix. Scope resolution. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>void getExcitedAboutCS()
{

    cheer(); 

    // Call NerdyStudent's cheer()
    // If not there, look for a cheer() in Student
    // If not there, look for it in Person(), etc. 

    Student::cheer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Calls the most derived version of the function that
we can. Example:  ReallyNerdyStudent would use NerdyStudent's
cheer() if it didn't redefine it. If NerdyStudent doesn't have
a cheer(), look in Person, etc. This is if we don't specify
which class' version of the function to use. </p>

<p>Can go up multiple levels in one step: ClassName::function();</p>

<p>To call from main():</p>

<pre><code>object.ClassName::function();
</code></pre>

<p>Again, can go up the hierarchy in one step. </p>

<p>We can have something like:</p>

<pre><code>void talk()
{
    // Modified speech

    Person::talk(); // Do stuff from the base class too
}
</code></pre>

<p>This a common pattern: have base class do some work,
have the derived class do some work. </p>

<a id="user-content-inheritance-and-construction" class="anchor" href="#inheritance-and-construction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inheritance and Construction</h4>

<p>Again, ShieldedRobot and Robot.</p>

<p>Rules:</p>

<p>Classes are constructed from superclasses
to subclasses. This makes sense! (Per Jaclyn)
We're building <em>what we need first</em> first, then
we build the rest. </p>

<p>They are <em>destructed</em> from subclasses to superclasses. </p>

<p>Imagine a Robot has a Battery member variable
and the ShieldedRobot has a ShieldGenerator. </p>

<p>The order of construction: </p>

<p>Build Robot's members (i.e. Battery and the primitives)
Build Robot
Build ShieldRobot's members (i.e. ShieldGenerator)
Build ShieldRobot</p>

<p>BaseClass's members, BaseClass, Subclass' members, subclass</p>

<p>Destruction is reversed, from sub to super:</p>

<p>ShieldedRobot, ShieldGenerator, Robot, Battery (as we learned
with class composition). </p>

<p>So it's the same as before, just accounting for the inheritance 
as well. Same as before for if something is derived
from two classes at once too. </p>

<p>In general:</p>

<p>base class members -&gt; base class -&gt; subclass members -&gt; subclass</p>

<p>What about with constructors that require parameters? </p>

<p>Let's have Duck, derived from Animal. </p>

<p>How do we initialize the Animal? With an initializer list
in Duck! </p>

<p>Rule: If a superclass requires parameters during
construction, then you must add an initializer list to
the subclass constructor. </p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>Duck() : Animal(2) // Arbitrarily: all Ducks weigh 2 lbs
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before Duck is constructed, Animal will be constructed
first. It MUST happen here, in the initializer list.
It CANNOT happen anywhere else. </p>

<p>In the first need for initializer list, with class composition, the
<em>containing class</em> has the initializer list. Here,
the subclass has the initializer list. </p>

<p>Does the order matter in the initializer list? No,
but some compilers may give warnings/errors in some warning modes. 
Also, remember that members are initialized </p>

<p>Can an Animal initialize from a parameter passed to Duck? </p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<pre><code>Animal(int weight, int coolness);
...
Duck(int weight, int coolness) : Animal(weight, coolness)
</code></pre>

<p>Paramters to Duck -&gt; Build Animal members -&gt; Build Animal
-&gt; Build Duck members -&gt; Build Duck</p>

<p>Oh, look a customized duck that has Animal characteristics!</p>

<p>Remember, the base class is always constructed before the derived
class. If Animal were derived from Organism and that needed
constructor parameters? Animal would need an initializer list too. </p>

<p>In general: a class intializes its superclass. 
In memory: an object of a class will have all of its members
plus the superclasses. </p>

<p>We can even customize parameters with expressions like
<code>weight - GLOBAL_CONSTANT</code>, etc. </p>

<p>In general: a subclass' constructor initializes ONLY
the subclass' members, but initializes its superclass,
if needed. Thus, going down the inheritance hierarchy,
our objects can become more and more detailed. </p>

<p>Again, destruction order
within a class: container destructor, member destructors</p>

<p>Could we derive from ? We could, but little point to it. </p>

<p>Before we run constructor/destructor, all the member variables
must be present! The 'structors may need them! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-inheritance-and-member-visibility" class="anchor" href="#inheritance-and-member-visibility" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inheritance and Member Visibility</h4>

<p>So, we have Robot and ShieldedRobot. Can a ShieldedRobot
member function access a Robot's private data? </p>

<p>NO! Because private data members are accessible ONLY
to the member functions of the <em>same class</em>. Derived classes
may NOT access the base class' private members. </p>

<p>Call base class' public functions instead. </p>

<p>What if ShieldedRobot had its own coordinate member
data? No problem. But a main() version call of setX()
would call the base class's version of setX(), and do nothing
with the subclass' setX(), unless we said <code>object.SubClass::setX()</code></p>

<p>IF there's no parametrized constructor, you must use
public member functions. </p>

<p>Once more: <strong>Derived classes may NOT access the private members
of their base classes.</strong></p>

<p>All private members of the base class are hidden from the derived
class, and may only be accessed via the public interface of the base
class. </p>

<p>"Proof": All animals have a spleen (private member). 
Can we touch our spleens?</p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-protected-members" class="anchor" href="#protected-members" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Protected Members</h5>

<p>If we want our derived class to access private member <em>functions</em> 
of the base class, use the <code>protected</code> access specifier:</p>

<pre><code>class Robot
{
    ...

    protected:
        void chargeBattery();
}
</code></pre>

<p>What about data members under protected? "Extremely bad style";
we're violating encapsulation! Then, we'd have to worry about changing
a lot of different stuff. </p>

<p>Now anything <em>derived</em> from the Robot class can access chargeBattery().
E.g., main() cannot call the protected member function; only the subclasses
can. </p>

<p>Overriding protected member functions is perfectly possible as well. s</p>

<p>Rules: </p>

<p>Public in base class B:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any function in class B can access it</p></li>
<li><p>Any function in classes derived from B can access it</p></li>
<li><p>All classes/functions unrelated to B may access it</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Private:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any function in B can access it</p></li>
<li><p>No functions in classes derived can access it</p></li>
<li><p>NO classes/functions unrelated to B can access it</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Protected:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any function in class B can access it</p></li>
<li><p>Any function in classes derived from B may access it</p></li>
<li><p>NO classes/functions unrelated to B can access it</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What if one instance of a derived instance is set equal
to another? By default, the copy constructor and the
assignment operator copies base data, then the derived data. 
This is a <em>shallow copy</em>. </p>

<p>BUT if the base or derived classes have dynamically allocated
member data, then both super and subclasses need a redefined
copy constructor and assignment operator. </p>

<p>Look to the PowerPoint. Subclass CC calls the superclass CC first. 
Subclass [=] calls the superclass [=] first.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-recap" class="anchor" href="#recap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recap</h4>

<p>We reuse code in a base class and derive new classes that
are specialized with new behaviors and data. 
E.g., Bat Mobile derived from Car.</p>

<p>Overriding redefines an existing behavior from the base class
with a new behavior in the derived class. </p>

<p>From office hours:</p>

<p>What if have classes A &amp; B,  and B's foo() calls
A's foo, but then we insert a new class in-between 
A &amp; B which also has foo()? </p>

<p>And in B, we said: A::foo()? Is there a way to make it go
up one level automatically? Not as far as we know right here.</p>

<p>But be careful:</p>

<pre><code>virtual void foo()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "..." &lt;&lt; endl;
    foo(); // RECURSION!
}
</code></pre>

<p>"What's a dummy node? "</p>

<p>In the linked list class,
have a member dummyNode of the node struct type.
The dummy node's value is irrelevant and unimportant. </p>

<p>Then, have the dummyNode's next point point to
the first actual node (the head pointer). </p>

<p>Why do this? With insertion, we'd have to have 
special code just for inserting at the very top.
With a dummy node, we're always inserting between
nodes; at the top, it's inserting between the dummy node
and the previous top node. </p>

<p>With a dummy node, we use its next pointer as the head
pointer; we don't need a head pointer. </p>

<p>How to know when we've hit the end of a circular list? 
If the node's next pointer points to the head pointer. </p>

<p>ONLY modify result after we've done all rule-following.
Double-check all the different cases of the possible
parameter combinations. </p>

<p>"What does <code>inline</code> mean?"</p>

<p>An inline function is one whose body is defined
in the class declaration. The <code>inline</code> keyword
in front of the function would be here: </p>

<p>This is only at the function definition (outside
the class declaration), NOT at its declaration,
but this IN THE HEADER FILE.</p>

<pre><code>inline _return_type ClassName::function() const
</code></pre>

<p>This keyword would mean that the function calls
arereplaced by the function's actual code. 
This is optional as to whether or not it actually
happens, and compiler-dependent.</p>

<p>Normally, a program would jump from function to function. </p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    public:

        void bar() { ... } // Automatically inline

};
</code></pre>

<p>Else, do: </p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    public: 

        void bar();
};

inline void Foo::bar()
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inline makes compile-time longer but run-time
shorter. </p>

someone who had purchased a lot of 
Symantec software. He there to schmooze
the person over dinner. There's
two guys; one is a VP, one is a director,
from an insurance company. The whole evening
he called Bill "Bob". The guy next to him
finally went "His name is Bill, not Bob."</p>

<p>Carey: "Bill, Bob, whatever."

<h3>
<a id="user-content-polymorphism" class="anchor" href="#polymorphism" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>This is not specific to C++, 
but shared across all OOP languages. </p>

<p>Consider a function that takes an object
of some class-type. Can it also accept
objects of sub-classes derived from that base class? </p>

<p>Yes! But this cannot go the other way around; 
e.g. cannot give Person to function expecting Student. </p>

<p>If a function accepts a <em>pointer or reference</em> to a
class-type, then we can also pass any objects of subclass-types!</p>

<p>Why? Because, a sub-class is IS the super-class;
anything a Person can do, a Student can do--and more! </p>

<p>The function <em>will not know</em> that that it's actuallly
working on an object of a derived class type. It just 
treats the object as being of the expected parameter type. </p>

<p>We could determine if the passed argument is of a derived
class type. Saved for office hours. </p>

<p>Any time we use a base pointer or reference to access
a derived object, this is called <strong>polymorphism</strong>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-shape-example" class="anchor" href="#shape-example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shape Example</h4>

<p>Consider a <code>Shape</code> base class. </p>

<p>It'll have a member function named <code>getArea()</code>,
made a virtual member function for overriding
in classes <code>Square</code> and <code>Circle</code>. </p>

<p>Square's getArea() calculates differently from 
Circle's, a consequence of geometry. </p>

<p>A problem? If we write a price calculator 
for each different shape; that's <em>code duplication</em>! </p>

<p>Instead, do it all in one function: </p>

<pre><code>void printPrice(const Shape&amp; s, const double price)
</code></pre>

<p>C++ will figure out which getArea() to call. 
It figures out the correct virtual function to call,
if it's been redefined. It will always use the most
derived version. This is all true even though
the printPrice() function has no idea
that it may be acting on a derived object. </p>

<p>You cannot use any functions that are not in 
the base class and also virtual. It'll even use
the base class version, if it's the right one. </p>

<p>If we pass by vlue, we'll encounter <em>slicing</em>. </p>

<p>In the base class, have all of the common things
that all the subclasses have in common. </p>

<p>Is there any way to do different things based on
the type of object passed in? Yes. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-inheritance-vs-polymorphism" class="anchor" href="#inheritance-vs-polymorphism" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inheritance vs. Polymorphism</h4>

<p>Inheritance: we derive one or more classes
from a base/super class. They all <em>inherit</em> a 
common set of functions and may redfine their own
specializaed functions. </p>

<p>Polymorphism: We may use a base pointer or reference 
to access any variable of a derived class type. 
The same function call autamtically casuses
different actions to occur, depending on what type
of variable is being pointed to/referenced. The
referred-to, pointed-to object automatically behaves
in an appropriate manner, without writing <em>special code</em>
for every single different type. </p>

<p>With polymorphism, we can design and implement systems
that are easily extensible.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-the-importance-of-virtual" class="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-virtual" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Importance of <code>Virtual</code>
</h4>

<p>The <code>virtual</code> keyword figures out what class is being
referenced and calls the right function. The
virtual keyword is a <em>necessity</em>. </p>

<p>Inside of the function using the base class type, 
functions specific to derived classes are <em>invisible</em>
to it! </p>

<p>When we forget <code>virtual</code>, C++ no longer looks
for the appropriate version of the function;
instead, it just uses the version found in the 
base class type. This is an insidious logic error!
In Java, everything is virtual by default. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>So, anytime we redefine a function, use <code>virtual</code>
in the base class <em>and</em> the derived classes. 
The functions are <code>virtual</code> from the base class
with the <code>virtual</code> keyword onward. Just put
<code>virtual</code> in the derived classes to be clear. </p></li>
<li><p>ALWAYS use the <code>virtual</code> keyword in destructors
in base <em>and</em> and derived classes. IF there is ANY
chance that a class may be use as a base class,
have <code>virtual</code> in its destructor declaration! </p></li>
<li><p>No such thing as a virtual constructor. (That's
not needed). </p></li>
</ol>

<a id="user-content-superclass-and-subclass-pointers" class="anchor" href="#superclass-and-subclass-pointers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Superclass and subclass Pointers</h4>

<p>Can we point a base class pointer to a
an object of a derived class type? YES,
because a derived object IS of a base class type.</p>

<p><em>In general, we can point a superclass pointer</em>
<em>at a subclassed variable.</em></p>

<p>Just note that the superclass pointer
cannot access any members specific to a subclass. </p>

<p>C++ will dynamically use the right virtual function.</p>

<p>"upcast" means that we point a superclass pointer
at a derived class object. </p>

<p>Always make the destructor in the base class
virtual. Every derived class' destructor is then
automatically virtual. </p>

<p>Whether we use a superclass pointer or subclass
pointer depends on what we need to with that object.</p>

<p>Story time: underprivileged kids from inner city
visit Symantec. </p>

<p>5 standing around Carey in a circle. He completely
repeated all around, completely forgetting a face
in just seconds! </p>

<p>Wait, what about the array of different Shapes?
Doesn't an array require that the memory be contiguous
and the elements be of the same size? Not here, 
because it's an array of <em>pointers</em>! </p>

<p>QUESTION: Can we point a subclassed pointer to a
superclass variable? NO! </p>

<p>While all Squares are a Shape, a Shape is not a square.
The relationship is one-way. </p>

<p>We may <em>never</em> point a derived class pointer/reference
to a base class variable. </p>

<p>Most-Derived</p>

<p>What is the rule for determining the "right"
function? C++ will select the <em>most-derived</em>
virtual function, even if that function is called
from a non-virtual function. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-virtual-destructors" class="anchor" href="#virtual-destructors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual Destructors</h4>

<p>IF we intend to derive a class from a base class,
that base class MUST have a <em>virtual destructor</em>. </p>

<p>DO NOT FORGET! </p>

<p>If we forget a virtual destructor, </p>

<p>Construction order: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Memory allocated</p></li>
<li><p>Superclass to subclass. 
-&gt; Members of class then class. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note, when we delete an object, C++
sees a death order on a base class type, 
but everything is virtual, so we call the sub class
destructor then the super class destructor.</p>

<p>Destruction order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Subclass to superclass</li>
</ol>

<p>If the pointer were to a subclass pointer, 
both destructors would be called (in the
same order: most-derived to most-basic), because
the subclass has the superclass bits too! 
<code>Virtual</code> is not needed so much then; the problem
is if we have a superclass pointer to a subclassed pointer,
then we need the <code>virtual</code> to call the correct most-derived
destructor.</p>

<p><em>We may not redefine any destructors from a more basic class</em>. </p>

<p>Say we have D derived from B:</p>

<pre><code>B
    m1

D
    m2
</code></pre>

<p>Construction: m1, B, m2, D - most basic (members first) to most derived</p>

<p>Destruction: ~D, ~m2, ~B, ~m1 - most-derived to most-basic</p>

<p>Never use assignment operators with polymorphism. </p>

<p>Technically, lacking the <code>virtual</code> with destructors
is <em>undefined</em> behavior. </p>

<p>Most of the time, C++ calls the base class' destructor,
and <em>never</em> calls the derived class' destructor. It frees
the memory, and we lose the pointers to any dynamic 
members of the derived class. <em>Memory leak</em>! </p>

<p>What if we have non-dynamic memory in the derived class? 
It's still undefined! Just put <code>virtual</code> in the base class! </p>

<p>This is if we have polymorphism; if the pointer
were to the subclass, the subclass destructor would be
called correctly, as well as the superclass destructor. </p>

<p><strong>Destructing a derived object always destructs up the hierarchy!</strong></p>

<p>The compiler will know the inheritance hierarchy and spit
back a compile-time error if we try to point a subclass pointer
at a superclass pointer. Note also that we cannot delete things
twice. Don't mix up pointers! </p>

<p><code>Virtual</code> destructors are only needed with polymorphism,
because then C++ may encounter situations where it's unsure
what needs to be destructed. THAT SAID, have the destructor
be virtual anyway, in case we later modify the code to use
polymorphism anyway. ALWAYS define a virtual destructor. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-vtables" class="anchor" href="#vtables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vtables</h4>

<p>When a variable is defined, an invisble "vtable"
is pointing to the proper set of functions to use,
with an entry for every virtual function in the class. 
ONLY virtual functions are found in this table. </p>

<p>If the variable is of a subclass type, its vtable
will have a pointer to its subclass version of the
virtual function. So, every object knows exactly
what version of the function to call. As long as 
the base class has <code>virtual</code>, that function is
virtual from then on.</p>

<p><em>We can have pointers to functions!</em></p>

<p>Note that the vtables are used at run-time,
not compile-time. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h4>

<p>First we figure out what we want to represent
in general. </p>

<p>Then we define a base class that contains functions
common to all of the derived classes. </p>

<p>Then we write our derived classes, creating specialized
versions of each common function. </p>

<p>We can then access derived variables with a base class
pointer or reference. </p>

<p>Finally, we must always have a virtual destructor in our
base class, whether it needs it or not. (Using
inheritance, create a virtual destructor!)</p>

<p>OMG: How many people have asked the exact same question: 
"Do the derived classes need <code>virtual</code> in front their 
function signatures?"</p>

<p>Does it make sense to have Shape objects? No, 
so its functions are really dummy functions. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-pure-virtual-functions" class="anchor" href="#pure-virtual-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pure Virtual Functions</h3>

<p>We <em>must</em> define functions that are common
to all derived classes in our <em>base class</em>
<em>to use polymorphism</em>. The lame thing is
the <em>dummy functions</em> in the derived classes.
(But without them, we wouldn't be able to 
use polymorphism). </p>

<p>// LOL, Carey and a student blowing a spider back and forth at each other. </p>

<p>Since they are never used, their implementations could be anthing. 
But it'd be even better if we could remove them altogether. </p>

<p>We define <em>abstract functions</em></p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>virtual _returnType _identifer() = 0; 
</code></pre>

<p>These are called <strong>pure virtual functions</strong>. </p>

<p>Rules. </p>

<ol>
<li>Make a base class function pure virtual if we realize
that the base-class version does not do anything useful. </li>
</ol>

<p>Pure virtual functions can be in subclasses too! </p>

<p>If a base class has a pure virtual function,
then its derived classes <em>must</em> define their own version
of it. </p>

<p>If a class has <em>at least one</em> pure virtual function,
than it is called an <strong>abstract base class</strong> (ABC). 
Not "American Born Chinese", haha. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-abstract-base-classes" class="anchor" href="#abstract-base-classes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract Base Classes</h3>

<p>Rules: </p>

<ol>
<li>Must either provide code for <em>all</em> pure virtual functions</li>
<li>Or the derived class becomes an abstract base class itself!</li>
</ol>

<p>Some definitions can be omitted, then the derived class 
effectively has that pure virtual function too. </p>

<p>Look up the inheritance hierarchy: does it have defined
versions from previous superclasses, and then fills in the 
rest? If so, that function is considered defined.</p>

<p><em>If a class is an ABC</em>, we <em>CANNOT define any instances of it</em>
but we can define pointers to them. </p>

<p>But, if there is at least one function that is an inherited
pure virtual function, and we don't redefine them, then
the subclass becomes an ABC itself, and we cannot define
any instances of it. </p>

<p>Note: we do not repeat the PVF in the subclass; it
just inherits it; it "virtually" has the pure virtual function.</p>

<p>Why would we use PVFs and ABCs? IT forces the programmer
to implement certain functions to prevent common mistakes,
like forgetting to implement the specialized virtual functions
of subclasses. </p>

<p>If we forget (and the forgotten function is not made pure virtual),
then we call the base class version by mistake. If we did pure virtual,
then we'd get an area, look at it and go ("Wait, that's not an ABC.
Wait, there's supposed to be a virtual function specialiazed to
that class derived from Shape!" Oh, right, I did not implement...")</p>

<p>Pure virtual functions <em>force the programmer to implement</em>
the <em>correct versions in the derived class</em>. </p>

<p>Still, we can use ABC pointers and references; this lets 
us do polymorphism with that base class (and therefore
pass in instances of derived classes). We never use the
ABC member functions; instead, we call the redefined virtual functions
of the derived types. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>void printPrice(Shape&amp; s)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we <em>cannot pass-by-value with an ABC</em>. That would require
creating a Shape, which is illegal with an ABC. </p>

<p>Also legal, </p>

<pre><code>void printPrice(
</code></pre>

<p>It's almost like, we're able to see through a paper cutout;
it just masks what we see. We see the actual thing we need through
the paper.</p>

<p>In summary, pure virtual functions let us:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Avoid writing dummy logic</p></li>
<li><p>Force the programmer to implement derived class' functions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and remember, <em>virtual destructor</em> in the base class, <strong>always</strong>. </p>

<p>As before, we can do an ABC pointer or reference to
an instance of a derived class. </p>

<p>But we would not be able to point an ABC pointer to an ABC instance;
because we cannot create any instances of an ABC! This also means
<em>no arrays</em> of an ABC; but we can do an array of Animal <em>pointers</em>. </p>

<p>But we could do ABC pointers to ABC pointers. </p>

<p>There may be constructors for ABCs, but that doesn't mean
that they will not ABCs (we cannot have virtual constructors). </p>

<p>What if we had</p>

<p>Animal - ABC
Insect - ABC (derived from Animal)
Fly - regular
Ant - regular</p>

<pre><code>Fly f;
Ant a;

Animal* p;

p = &amp;a; // Point to 

p = &amp;f;
</code></pre>

<p>Can this be done? Yes. Animal is a superclass to Fly and Ant. 
But we cannot point subclass pointers to superclasses;
not all Animals are Ants. </p>

<p>We could also do:</p>

<pre><code>Insect* i; 

i = &amp;a; 
i = &amp;f; 
</code></pre>

<p>Ant and Fly are derived from Insect. </p>

<p>Subclass destructor will run, then superclass destructor
will run, automatically. </p>

<p>WE MUST PRACTICE SOLVING RECURSION PROBLEMS!</p>

<p>It's time for what Joel Spolosky called
"the big guns" of coding interview questions:</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-recursion" class="anchor" href="#recursion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recursion</h3>

<p>Carey describes it as "one of the most difficult
topics in computer science", but it does let us
do all sorts of stuff. It's apparently his favorite
lecture of the quarter! </p>

<p>Stacks &amp; queues let us solve mazes and write
calculators that can process whole natural 
expressions. Linked lists underpinned stacks
and queues. </p>

<p>Inheritance and polymorphism let us avoid
code duplication and easily extend our existing
code to meet new needs. </p>

<p>And now, recursion will let us do stuff like 
play chess or checkers, solve Sudoku puzzles (in ~15 lines),
and crack codes or ciphers. It is a big, difficult
gun, but wieled well, we'll finally be able to do
all the cool stuff that pop culture promised us! </p>

<p>It'll also let us do mathy stuff
like factorials! </p>

<a id="user-content-thinking-paradigm-behind-recursion" class="anchor" href="#thinking-paradigm-behind-recursion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thinking Paradigm Behind Recursion</h4>

<p>Previously, we did problem-solving in a function with 
breaking stuff down into smaller, constituent
problems, solving each of them with sub-functions, 
then gathering the solutions into one for the
overarching problem. </p>

<p>With recursion, we'll solve the sub-problems
by calling the larger function on itself! </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-lazy-persons-sort" class="anchor" href="#lazy-persons-sort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"Lazy Person's Sort"</h5>

<p>We have a pile of index cards with numbers on them. 
We want to sort the cards. Solution: hand off half to
one person, half to another person, have them sort their
respective halves, the recombine the sorted halves. </p>

<p>Problem: too many cards. </p>

<p>Solution: each of the slaves/willing assistants calls
on two other people each themselves. It's a sort of pyramid:</p>

<pre><code>            A
        B       B
      C   C   C   C
     D D D D D D D D
           ...
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: if there is only card left, it cannot
be split up. </p>

<p>Solution: if handed only card, give it right back;
it's already "sorted". </p>

<p>This is known as <strong>merge sort</strong>. </p>

<p>We just saw the power of calling a function on itself
repeatedly to solve sub-problems that eventually solves
the whole problem. </p>

<p>Each broken-up sub-part may not be of the same
size. Just like how a Riemann Sum may not have
a uniform partition size. </p>

<p>So how do we get to the actual merging part
if we keep calling ourself? </p>

<p>Basically, we go down and down till we hit
the base case, then we return back up, merging and
merging little stuff. <em>Merge sort</em> is apparently
one of the most efficient algorithms known to humanity. </p>

<p>Our job with recursion: how can our function use itself
(on increasingly smaller subsets) to get the complete
problem solved? It must be able to work on the full set
or a subset. We must have faith like Indiana Jones crossing
that bridge! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-the-two-rules-of-recursion" class="anchor" href="#the-two-rules-of-recursion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Two Rules of Recursion</h4>

<p><strong>ONE: Every recursive function must have a stopping condition</strong>. </p>

<p>The stopping condition (base case): The recursive function
is able to solve the simplest, most basic instance of its
problem <em>without using recursion</em>. Instead, it runs once, 
then <em>stops calling itself</em>. (Example: base case for merge sort
is a single element). </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>void eatTootsieRollPop(int layers)
{
</code></pre>

<p>// This is the stopping condition
// In the base case of zero or less, 
// we run once (more) and end! </p>

<pre><code>    if (layers &lt;= 0)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "We've hit the center!" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return; // Don't forget to end!
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Licking!" &lt;&lt; endl;

    eatTootsieRollPop(layers - 1); // Recursion! Calling itself!
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Without a stopping condition</em>, a recursive function
would <em>run ad infinitum</em>, something we definitely do not
want to have happen. It'd be infinite Inception!</p>

<p>What happens if a recursive function actually does
go on forever? Well, the call stack would overflow
and we'll crash. </p>

<p><strong>TWO: Every recursive function must have a "simplifying step"</strong></p>

<p>Every time that the recursive function calls itself, 
a <em>smaller</em> sub-problem must be passed into, so that we
<em>eventually reach the stopping condition</em> and terminate. </p>

<p>Without this simplifying condition, we'll never reach
that stopping condition. </p>

<p>From previous example: <code>(layers - 1)</code> </p>

<p>// A <em>copied value</em> that is equal to <code>layers - 1</code>
// Layers is not actually modified; <code>layers--</code> would modify it</p>

<p>// PBR vs. PBR is case-dependent; modifying the counter
// would not always work [also, that counter would have
// to come from outside the function; we'd be recreating
// it every time otherwise]</p>

<p>Without that, we would never reach the stopping condition
of <code>if (layers &lt;= 0)</code></p>

<p>Most recursive functions meet this second rule
by <em>splitting their inputs into two</em> with each call, 
or by operating on an input <em>one smaller</em> in size than the last.</p>

<p>Is it better to divide many times? It depends on the problem. 
We'll be able to mathematically analyze this later on. </p>

<p><strong>TWO.5: Recursive functions must only use local variables &amp; parameters</strong></p>

<p>Using globals, statics or class member variables would
be an atrocious idea. This is not <em>always</em> wrong, but almost
all of the time, it is a bad idea. </p>

<p><em>NEVER use a loop</em> within a recursive function 
unless absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>The parameter-passing method is irrelevant (value, reference, pointer)</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-tracing-through-recursion" class="anchor" href="#tracing-through-recursion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tracing Through Recursion</h4>

<p>Tracing through a complex recursive function
can be confusing. To alleviate the headaches, 
we can pretend that each recursive call is a call
to a different function that just happens to have the same name. </p>

<p>This helps a lot with tracing the function returns. </p>

<p>On paper, this can be done by writing down 
all the variables and parameters, and then repeatedly folding
and unfolding the paper to avoid confusion over the returned values. </p>

<p><em>Distinguish between the different calls of the same recursive function</em></p>

<p>"How do you lick something with no layers? That could be misconstrued
as something inappropriate."</p>

<p>Does C++ actually copy the function? No, this is just for visualization. </p>

<p>The debugger would show us going into the call again and again;
the variables watcher would show us the current state with the current
call; Visual Studio will let us go up and down the stack to see the different
call states. I'll have to see if Xcode lets us do the same. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-wielding-recursion" class="anchor" href="#wielding-recursion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wielding Recursion</h4>

<p>Here is how to write a recursive function: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write the function signature</p></li>
<li><p>Show how to use the function</p></li>
<li><p>Add the base case code</p></li>
<li><p>Add the recursive function call</p></li>
<li><p>Write the function's completion logic</p></li>
<li><p>Validate the function</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Example: we want to calculate a factorial. </p>

<p>Step 1: Write the function header</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What arguments need to be passed to the function and how?</p></li>
<li><p>What should the function return? </p></li>
<li><p>If this is a member function, should the function be <code>const</code>?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our example will be <code>int factorial(int number)</code></p>

<p>Step 2: Show how to use our function</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Who calls this function, and from where? </p></li>
<li><p>How does it handle an input of size N vs size N - 1? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Example calls: </p>

<pre><code>int threeItemMenuPossibilites = factorial(3);
int nowTwo = factorial(2);
</code></pre>

<p>In general:</p>

<pre><code>int var1 = factorial(n);    // Gives us n!
int var2 = facotiral(n - 1) // Gives us (n - 1)!
</code></pre>

<p>Step 3: Add the base case code</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identify the simplest possible inputs</p></li>
<li><p>Add checks for these base cases (there may be multiple!)</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the problem <em>without using recursion</em></p></li>
<li><p>Always consider <em>all</em> possible base cases!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, 0! would be the base case. 
0!, by the way, is equal to 1. </p>

<pre><code>int factorial(int number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return 1; 

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 4: Simplify the input &amp; call ourselves</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Split or modify the input as needed</p></li>
<li><p>Have the function call itself to solve the larger part</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We currently have:</p>

<pre><code>int factorial(int number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return 1; 

    int N = number; 
    int minusOne = ... // Need (N - 1)!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, right--recursion!</p>

<pre><code>int factorial(int number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return 1; 

    int N = number; 
    int minusOne = factorial(number - 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is our <em>simplifying code</em>, which here gets
us one closer to the base case with each recursive call. </p>

<p>Step 5: Write the completion logic</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get the result from the recursive call</p></li>
<li><p>Further refine/process it, as needed</p></li>
<li><p>Return the finished product</p></li>
</ul>

<p>int factorial(int number)
{</p>

<pre><code>if (number == 0)
    return 1; 

int one = number; 
int minusOne = factorial(number - 1);

return (one * minusOne);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Here, we recursively go down the number line
from the input, then hit bottom, and bounce back
up on the multiplicative wave! </p>

<p>It goes: 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 0.</p>

<p>Then it goes 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5!</p>

<p>Step 6: Validate our new function</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Validate the neonate function, <em>always</em></p></li>
<li><p>Try the simplest possible inputs first</p></li>
<li><p>Try increasingly complex/large inputs</p></li>
<li><p>After one recursive call check, we're usually good</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternative formulation of the steps (Carey really
does update the slides every year): </p>

<p>Step 1: Write the function header</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What will the function return</p></li>
<li><p>What do we need to pass to the function? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the factorial example, we pass
in an unsigned integer, and we return an
unsigned integer. </p>

<p>Step 2: Define the magic function</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assume that David Smallberg created a 
magic function that always works that
does what we want to do </p></li>
<li><p>It takes the same parameters, and
return the same result-type</p></li>
<li><p>Restriction: It cannot work on problems 
of size N. It CAN work on problems of size
less than N</p></li>
<li><p>Show how to use this magic function to
solve problems of size elss than N</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine we already have a magic function.
Show how we could use it. </p>

<p>Define a magic function, that has teh same paraemters 
but CANNOT wrok on a value of size N, so we can't do 
N! but we can do (N - 1)!</p>

<p>Step 3: Add the base case code</p>

<p>Determine the base case(s) and solve it (them)
<em>without recursion</em>. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the simplest sub-problem(s) the function
can solve <em>without</em> recursion? </p></li>
<li><p>What inputs allow us to immediately return
some result without having the function call itself? </p></li>
<li><p>There may be <em>multiple base cases</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here, 0! = 1. </p>

<p>Step 4: Solve the problem with the magic function</p>

<p>We can't use the magic function to do all the work,
so break the problem into smaller parts:</p>

<p>N! = N * (N - 1)!</p>

<p>A factorial can be redefined as the top number
times the factorial of the top - 1 number, e.g.
5! = 5 * 4! or 5! = 5 * (5 - 1)!</p>

<p>We already have N; no need for the magic function.</p>

<p>So we use David Smallberg's magic funcion on the 
(N - 1)! part.  </p>

<p>Then we combine the results and return it. </p>

<pre><code>int part1 = N; 
int part2 = magicFactorial(N - 1);

return part1 * part2; 
</code></pre>

<p>Step 5: Remove the magic</p>

<p>magicFactorial()
{
    factorial()
}</p>

<p>We just call ourselves!
The sub-problem(s) is/are solved
by our own function. We trust that our function
will work on problems of sizes smaller than N. </p>

<p>The problem: If our function calls itself,
what stops it from calling itself forever? </p>

<p>Answer: the base case code ensures that eventually
we stop calling ourselves. </p>

<p>Step 6: Validate the recursive function</p>

<p>ALWAYS try our new function on the simplest possible
input, then verify it with increasingly larger/more complex
inputs. VERIFY that our implementation works. Typically,
just one larger is enough to verify the function.</p>

<p>This lets us catch our mistakes! </p>

<p>Note that every recusrive call will create new copies
of the local parameters and variables. We use the call
stack for all this. Runaway recursive functions will
cause a stack overflow. </p>

<p>Note also how the recursive calls match up with
the factorial process: </p>

<p>3! = 3 * 2 * 1 </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-static-variables" class="anchor" href="#static-variables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Static Variables</h4>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    static int a; // Static primitive types are initialized to 0

    cout &lt;&lt; a;

    a = a = 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When we exit the function, the variable's lifetime is till
the end of the program; but its scope is limited to foo().</p>

<p>It has the lifetime, but not the scope of a global. </p>

<p>Try to avoid statics. They are one way to check how often a 
a function is called, but that's just as easily accomplished
with a counter variable (of a longer lifetime and large scope)
passed into the function (by reference or pointer).</p>

<p>Note also that <code>a</code> would not be re-initialized to 0
with each call to foo(). </p>

<p>A static class instance would have its default constructor 
called. Making recursion problems easier is possible
with globals or statics but they should never be necessary. 
Do it the real way; use the full power of recursion! </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-recursion-on-arrays" class="anchor" href="#recursion-on-arrays" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recursion on Arrays</h3>

<p>// Carey is in a dress shirt and pants; 
// Symantec has a Top 150 people in the company
// meeting in San Francisco today, apparently. 
// Apple does the same thing, but with top ~100</p>

<p>Now, we'll use recursion to get the sum of all
items in an array. </p>

<ol>
<li>Function header</li>
</ol>

<p>We need the array and its size. </p>

<p><strong>Arrays may never be passed by reference</strong></p>

<pre><code>sumArray(int arr*, int n);
</code></pre>

<p>OR: </p>

<pre><code>sumArray(int arr[], int n); 
</code></pre>

<p>We return the sum of all the values. </p>

<pre><code>int sumArray(int arr*, int n);
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We have a magic function</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that Carey is just making this up
as a crutch to help us learn recursion.</p>

<p>Assume that the magic function does not
use recursion.  </p>

<p>It looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>int magicSumArray(int arr*, int n);
</code></pre>

<p>Where n is &lt; N. Smallberg put a booby trap in it! </p>

<p>To sum up smaller arrays:</p>

<pre><code>magicSumArray(arr, n - 1); 
</code></pre>

<p>To get last n - 1 elements: <code>(arr + 1, n - 1)</code></p>

<p>This gets us the element at index 1, the second
element of an array that starts its indexing at 0. 
Remember that arr + 1 gets us to the next element,
moving by the type size, not the number of bytes. </p>

<p>To get the first half: <code>(arr, n/2)</code></p>

<p>To get the last half: <code>(arr + n/2, n - n/2)</code></p>

<p>--&gt; Advance to middle half, then iterate
over the remaining items, which means there are
n - n/2 items remaining (this also accounts for
if there are an odd number of elements in the array). </p>

<ol>
<li>Determine base cases</li>
</ol>

<p>What's the base case here? An empty array,
which has a sum of 0. </p>

<p>If there is only one element, then the sum is
just that the one element, the arr[0]. </p>

<p>It is better to have have extra base cases for 
safety, then to not have them. We can always
remove redundancies later on. </p>

<ol>
<li>Use magic</li>
</ol>

<p>We need to break down our problem into smaller
sub-problems. </p>

<p>We can go </p>

<ul>
<li>Front-to-back</li>
</ul>

<p>We process the first N -1 elements, <em>ignoring</em>
the last element. Then we get the last element 
separately, and add up the two quantities. </p>

<pre><code>int front = magicSumArray(arr, n - 1);
int back = arr[n - 1];

return front + back;
</code></pre>

<p>Or </p>

<pre><code>return front + a[n -1]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Back-to-front </li>
</ul>

<p>We process the last n - 1 elements
and ignore the first element. Then later
add the first element. </p>

<pre><code>int rear = magicSumArray(arr + 1, n - 1);
return a[0] + rear; 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Divide and conquer</li>
</ul>

<p>We process the first half, the second half,
and then combine them: </p>

<p>Yes, this does print ou t in reverse,
this is because we are recursive here! </p>

<p>It hits an empty, then propagates backwards. </p>

<p>Each call of the company of the recursive
function sees a different version of the 
array. </p>

<p>Note that the last call passes in a location
in memory past the end of the array, but our

<p>Typically we just go down a linked list. </p>

<p>We'll pass a pointer to a node (could be
a dummy node, or follow the head pointer to the
first node). </p>

<p>We don't need a size value; we can just determine
based on the next pointer. </p>

<p>If it's a circular linked list, we need a special
case check for if we've hit first node again. </p>

<p>On an exam, <em>never assume</em> that an array or a linked
list is not empty. </p>

<p>Function that finds the biggest item in a linked list. </p>

<pre><code>struct Node
{
    int m_val; 
    Node* m_next
};

int biggest(Node* cur); 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it's hard to know where the middle
of the link list,  unless we maintained a pointer
to it. </p>

<p>We need to act on a subset of the list. </p>

<p>So we can use the array strategies, acting 
on the last N - 1 items, or first N - 1 items,
then checking against the value of the first node
or the last node. </p>

<pre><code>// It's probably gonna be the head pointer, 
// but we could find the biggest part of just
// part of the list 
int biggest(Node* cur)
{
    // [ERROR]: Empty linked list!
    if (cur == nullptr)
    {
        return -1;
    }

    // Only one node in linked list
    if (cur-&gt;next == nullptr)
    {
        return cur-&gt;m_val;
    }

    // The value of the first node
    int candidate1 = cur-&gt;m_val;

    // Otherwise, find biggest in the
    // rest of the list
    int candidate2 = biggest(cur-&gt;next);

    int winner = (candidate1 &gt;= candidate2) ? candidate1 : candidate2;

    return winner;

    // OR: return (candidate1 &gt;= candidate2) ? candidate1 : candidate2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When we get to the bottom, we compare one item to the n - 1
item, then we compare that winnner against the next value,
and we take that winner and compare against the next value,
and eventually we'll have the biggest value in the whole list.</p>

<p>This is like a rock-paper-scissors tournament, modified
so that it runs linearly (rather than concurrently/in parallel),
and propagates downward to two people (we're creating pairs)
and then we compete back up the pairs (we're assuming ability
is absolute, i.e. no luck, and re-running the tournament
would deterministically give the same result, as here when
we compare numbers). </p>

<p>Carey did a "Biggest gets head, lucky biggest";
he apparently wanted to do this during the linked
list lecture, but Kim was delivering that one, so he
decided that it would have been inappropriate, haha. </p>

<p>Recursion is a memory hog. Why? 
Because we're constantly pushing the function's 
variables onto the stack for each call.</p>

<p>There is only copy of the function in the 
machine code, but we do have multiple copies 
of its variables.  </p>

<p>So, if possible, do a problem without recursion,
unless we're just doing it for practice. </p>

<p>If we do N - 1 for a sub-problem, then we'll end up
with N copies of all the variables and we'll eventually
cause a stack overflow. </p>

<p>If we can do stuff with a for-loop, do not do 
it with recursion. Recursion is used on the difficult stuff. 
Don't use it unless our recursive calls don't go too deep. </p>

<p><strong>Klinger story</strong>: small graduate computer vision class. </p>

<p>Professor always brought in food like oranges, and hard-boiled
eggs. The professor asked a  question, and some guy gave a response:
"The purple pyramid!" (he normally said nonsense). </p>

<p>The professor: "That's absolutely right!"</p>

<p>Leonardo made a funny face, and he vibrated a table with a tray
of pastries. The tray fell over and sent pastries flying.</p>

<p>"The pastries are flying!" and he ran out of the class. </p>

<p>He still got an A- in the class. </p>

<hr>

<p>In the maze example, we had an <strong>implicit base case</strong>, where we hit
the end of the function after propagating back up, and simply 
hit the end of the function without doing anything. </p>

<p>That allowed for <strong>backtracking</strong> to the last valid good
exploratory position. Cool animation in the PowerPoint!</p>

<p>Notice that it when it hits the solution, it will keep on
looking and explore <em>every</em> possibility in the array, 
despite having the solution.</p>

<p>Look up the <em>Minimax algorithm</em> (minimize/maximize) 
is a recursive algorithm for creating an intelligent computer
AI opponent. It picks the best move for the computer by 
silently trying each legal move and seeing how the game woud
have turned out. It simulates an ideal human player during
this simulation. It examines a big tree of possibilities
against possibilties. </p>

<p>We can tell the algorithm how far ahead we want it to
check (e.g. 3 levels deep). </p>

<p>At the base case level, do a <em>static evaluation</em>, and 
see who's winning, black or white, e.g. with a number, +/-. </p>

<p>Otherwise, repeatedly (every move computer can make)&lt;
then it temporarily changes the board and checks
how a human would respond (What's the worst a human could?)
, then it returns the best move possibility for the computer. </p>

<p>A findBestHumanMove() is very similar to findBestCompMove();
they <strong>co-recur</strong>. This is <strong>co-recursion</strong>. </p>

<p>The computer will remember all the resulting scores
from the possible combination of moves. </p>

<p>So, the difficulty of the computer opponent will be
determined (primarily) by how far ahead it looks and
analyzes. </p>

<p>The best chess programs don't go deep uniformly; 
that takes too much time and too much computational power.

<a id="user-content-generic-programming" class="anchor" href="#generic-programming" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generic Programming</h3>

<p>The war on code and functionality duplication. 
We keep learning more ways to make our programs
highly extensible and adaptive to our needs. </p>

<p><strong>Generic programming</strong> means we'll be able to
build stuff (especially algorithms and data structures) 
that can work on many kinds of data, e.g. a linked list
that can serve as a container for Students as well as
ints, etc. Similarly, we want a sort() that can sort
many different things.</p>

<p>This is <strong>code reuse</strong>. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-custom-comparison-operators" class="anchor" href="#custom-comparison-operators" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Custom Comparison Operators</h3>

<p>First, know that we can overload operators like
<code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> just like we did 
the assignment operator <code>==</code>. </p>

<p>To overload within a class:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass 
{
    public:

        ...
        bool operator&lt;(const SomeClass&amp; other)
        {
            if ( // Compare data members, etc. ) 
                return true;
            else
                return false;
        }

    private:

        ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Would this work with derived classes? This would compare
only the Dog part, and not the GoldenRetriever() part. </p>

<p>As before, this can happen outside of the class too: </p>

<p>// Note that outside the class, we'll need two operands
// Inside the class, the calling object is treated as the first
// operand; note also that operator overloading requires that
// at least one of the operands be of a class type (though
// we can also have primitives passed in parameters, e.g. compare
// our custom Number class to an int)</p>

<p>// ORDER MATTERS; we have to do Dog vs. Cat, and a separate
// Cat vs. Dog</p>

<p>// We can also compare class types against other class types;
// This would be </p>

<p>// In general, PBCR</p>

<pre><code>bool operator&lt;(const SomeClass&amp; other, const SomeClass&amp; another)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>// NOTE: If the operator is overloaded outside of the class,
// its implementation will ONLY be able to use the class' public
// members</p>

<p>// ALSO: We cannot have more operands than the built-in
// operators expect. </p>

<p>It may be helpful to recall that <code>fido &lt;= spot</code>
is equivalent to <code>fido.operator=(spot)</code></p>

<p><strong>There is NO default comparison operator</strong> for programmer-defined
class types.</p>

<p>This is <em>static binding</em>, meaning we know at compile-time what
sort of variable we have. <em>Dynamic binding</em> means we have to figure
out at run-time what sort of variable we're actually dealing with,
as with polymorphism. </p>

<p>Generic programming is <em>powerful</em>!  With it, we
can write programs far more quickly; it's a great force
multiplier. This is a common paradigm among modern languages.</p>

<p>Here, we get to avoid writing special code for comparing
different objects (which also avoids accidental comparison
using different standards, or comparing using different data members). </p>

<p>Finally: if the objects passed into the overloaded operator are <code>const</code>,
then any member functions we call better be <code>const</code> too. </p>

<p>Prime example: cout's <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is an overloaded operator. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-templates" class="anchor" href="#templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Templates</h3>

<p>Previously, we sort of did generic functions with <code>typedef</code>. 
It sucks though, because we're constantly having to change
the typedef declaration whenever we want to change the data type
we use. </p>

<ol>
<li>Declare the template type</li>
<li>Use that type throughout the generic function</li>
</ol>

<p>To have a swap() function that works with any data type,
we can do: </p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename Blah&gt;
void swap(Blah a, Blah b)
{
    // This assumes that the assignment operator is correctly defined
    Blah temp;
    temp = a; 
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that  will only apply to the immediately
following function or class. </p>

<p>We can also write <code>template&lt;class Blah&gt;</code></p>

<p>With this current definition, we expect swap()'s arguments
to be of the same type. Now, it can be any type, but the arguments
must be of the same type. </p>

<p>We <code>typename</code> or <code>class</code> to be succeeded by a generic identifier.</p>

<p>This swap() would work on two arguments of the same subclass;
because they're just items of the same type! We could use a superclass'
assignment operator if we wanted to. </p>

<p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>What if we had <code>template&lt;class Blah&gt;</code> and created a class Blah?
Would that be allowed? I'll try and find out! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-template-implementation-details" class="anchor" href="#template-implementation-details" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Template Implementation Details</h4>

<p>The entire templated function is put in a header file. 
It CANNOT be split between a header and source file,
e.g. what we did before with a prototype and definition.</p>

<p>At compile-time, the compiler will generate a new version (machine code)
of the function for each new variable type. The compiled
executable will grow in size (little different from if we had
written many different function versions for, but the source 
file would be smaller).</p>

<p>Templates are time-saving and bug-reducing and source-simplifying! </p>

<p>NOTE: We must use the template data type for <em>at least one parameter</em>
or we'll have an error (i.e. we cannot use it for just a return-type). </p>

<p>When we use a templated function that expects two or more parameters
of the same name, e.g. <code>max(Blah x, Blah y)</code>, then we must pass in
two arguments to max() that are of the same type, e.g. two Cats,
two Dogs, but NOT an int and a float. </p>

<p>QUESTION: Could we define a templated comparison operator? 
Would that be a good idea? It seems redundant though. </p>

<p>We can override a templated function with a specialized function
specific to a class type. We'll use the most specialized version
(e.g. one that compares additional data members of a subclass). </p>

<p>Note that any operators we use inside of the generic functions
must be properly overloaded. To speed up that implementation work,
we could use operators within operator overloads, e.g. using
<code>==</code> and <code>&lt;</code> inside of the overload for <code>&lt;=</code></p>

{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-generic-classes" class="anchor" href="#generic-classes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generic Classes</h4>

<p>We can have generic classes too, ones that can hold any sort
of data. </p>

<p>AGAIN: Everything goes into a header file</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename Item&gt;
class SomeClass
{

    public:
        void setVal(Item a)
        {
            m_a = a;
        }

        // Don't redefine the ints here;
        // we don't need to!
        void print()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
                cout &lt;&lt; m_a;
        }

    private:

        Item m_a;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we would have to redefine how <code>cout</code>
works for class types. </p>

<p>NOTE: In a class, we do NOT need to use the template data type.
That would be lame to not use it though. Double-check this. </p>

<p>Note that we can only overload the primitive operators;
we cannot create new operators. </p>

<p>To create an instance of a generic class:</p>

<pre><code>SomeClass&lt;typeWeWantToUse&gt; instanceOfGenericClass;

ClassName&lt;int&gt; object1;
</code></pre>

<p>To define member functions externally, note that we use:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Blah&gt;
class Foo
{
    ...
    void bar(Blah a);
    ...
};


template&lt;class Blah&gt;
void Foo&lt;Blah&gt;::bar(Blah a)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p> goes between <code>ClassName</code> and <code>::</code></p>

<p>Check syntax for multi-type templates?</p>

<pre><code>void Foo&lt;Blah, Item&gt;::function(Blah a, Item b)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is all in the header file; we're just writing the 
bodies outside of the class definition. If it's inside the class
definition, we don't need to write <code>inline</code> (but if we didn't intend
to inline, define them outside of the class. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-inline-methods" class="anchor" href="#inline-methods" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inline Methods</h3>

<p>Inline methods are a request to the compiler (compilers
do not have to honor it) to directly embed a function's
call with its body logic (replace the call and jump
with the machine code definition of the function).</p>

<p>Functions declared <em>and defined</em> inside of a class are implicitly
inline. To do so outside of the class: </p>

<pre><code>inline void Foo&lt;Blah&gt;::functionName(Blah b) const
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, if this is a templated function, this is ALL in
the header file (we're just defining the function outside of
the class definition, but it's ALL in the header file). </p>

<p>This is some really ugly syntax...</p>

<p>This is faster. Why would we avoid inlining everything? 
We'd be copying that code and duplicating all over the place,
creating a really large binary, and we'll hit diminishing returns
as we use up memory. </p>

<p>BUT: This heavily slows down compilation.</p>

<p>Inlining is a trade-off between compilation time and execution time.</p>

<p>Templated classes allow us to build powerful linked lists and
other data structures. Now, our data structures can hold any sort
of data. (Make sure our templated classes work perfectly; then,
we'll never have to rewrite data structure classes)</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-stl" class="anchor" href="#stl" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STL</h3>

<p>The STL is a set of pre-written (and tested!) classes,
all implemented with templates. </p>

<p>Boom! Time-saver</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-vector" class="anchor" href="#vector" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vector</h4>

<p>A  is a dynamically-size array. It does NOT have a 
fixed size. They grow/shrink auto-magically/</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

using std::vector;

    // To create an empty vector (0 elements)
    vector&lt;string&gt; myFirstVector;

    // OR:
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; myFirstVector;
</code></pre>

<p>This requires that the  has a default constructor!
No different from when we created arrays of stuff. If a class
required parameter(s) to its constructor, then we might
have a vector of pointers to instances of that class instead. </p>

<p><strong>All of a vector's initial elements are automatically initialized</strong>.
(using the default constructor)&gt;</p>

<p>All of its items are contiguous in memory. A vector basically 
dynamically allocates an array. When we hit the end, the 
class allocates a new, larger dynamic array, copies over the old
stuff, and deletes the old one. This is a big reason why 
vectors are slower. </p>

<p>Note that if the vector doubles in size when 
it fills up, then the capacity will quickly (out)grow the need.<br>
The vector-growth would be implementation-dependent. Who
knows what the STL does, haha. </p>

<p>Note that an array of a fixed size will always be faster
than a vector. This trade</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This will create a vector of 3 ints with initial value 4. </p>

<p>We could also do:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;Dog&gt; myPuppyFamily(3, "Fido");
</code></pre>

<p>What sort of constructors are needed here? Is a default
constructor still needed? </p>

<p>Vector member functions:</p>

<pre><code>// To add a new item to the end of the vector:

push_back()
</code></pre>

<p>There is NO push_front() function for vectors. </p>

<pre><code>// To read an existing item, use brackets, 
// just like with arrays
// '[]' is now an overloaded operator!

vals[number]
</code></pre>

<p>Bracks can only access existing items; if we go
out-of-bounds, we'll get memory access errors (just
as with arrays; because again, the underlying implementation
is a dynamically-allocated array). </p>

<pre><code>// To read/write the front or back elements
// of the vector:

front()
back()

// To remove the back item of the vector:
pop_back()
</code></pre>

<p>This means that if order matters for us, we need 
to be careful in how we push items to the vector
such that if we need to delete something, we have
that item at the end (we could write an exchange function
that swaps two values inside of the vector). </p>

<p>QUESTION: What parameters would that exchange function take?</p>

<pre><code>// To get the size of the vector (NOT the size of the
// underlying array)
size()
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that ONLY vectors have a <code>.size()</code>,
not arrays</p>

<pre><code>// To know if the vector is empty
empty()
</code></pre>

<p>ANSWER: Why must a templated class be completely in a 
header file?</p>

<p>Because C++ will create specialized versions for every 
time that the templated class is needed. If we have stuff
split up, that would have prevented the compiler from knowing
where the needed templated class is. </p>

<p>// These notes were taken 12 February 2014, to continue
// from the previous lecture on generic programming
// and STL </p>

<p>STL's  is a linked list for
us to use. It can be a list of anything,
so long as that type has a default constructor. </p>

<p>We can do:</p>

<pre><code>push_back()
pop_back()
front()
back()
size()
empty()
</code></pre>

<p>AND:</p>

<pre><code>push_front()
pop_front()

<p>Also: Brackets are NOT usable with 
Only usable with  or arrays. </p>

<p>So these are easy for insertion at head or
tail. </p>

<p>When do we use  vs a ? </p>

<p>Well, what if need to add stuff into
the middle? The linked list would be better
for inserting middle stuff, but the vector
would be better for <em>random access</em> throughout. </p>

<p>This comes from the implementation details. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-list-iteration" class="anchor" href="#list-iteration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>List Iteration</h5>

<p>How do we iterate through a list?</p>

<p>Unlike a vector, we don't have <code>[]</code> brackets, 
so we need another way of going through a  </p>

<p><em>None</em> of the other STL containers have an easy
way to go through themselves. </p>

<p>Say we have (works for lists, etc., etc stacks &amp; quques)</p>

<p>We'll use an iterator variable and is like a pointer
but it used only for STL containers. Typically have it
start pointing it at some item, then increment and decrement
to go up/down the container. The iterator can also
<em>read/write</em> the item it points to. </p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; myVec; 

// This is an iterator
// specific to a vector 
// of ints

vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator it;

// Here, we create an iterator (scope resolved
// and clarified as being an iterator for a
// vector of ints) named it

// container&lt;data_type&gt;::iterator _name
</code></pre>

<p>To use it:</p>

<pre><code>// To point at first item of container

it = myVec.begin(); 
</code></pre>

<p>// CANNOT do </p>

<pre><code>it = myVec.front();
</code></pre>

<p>front() gives a value; begin() gives the location </p>

<p>The iterator can point it at any other vector of ints here. 
It's like a pointer. </p>

<p>Once the iterator points at a item, we can access
the item's value, we can use:</p>

<pre><code>// '*' operator has been overloaded

*it;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we're dereferencing an iterator. </p>

<p>To move down one item: </p>

<pre><code>it++; 
</code></pre>

<p>'++' has also been overloaded to get us to the next item. 
With a  we can do <code>+=</code>. </p>

<p>There are no safeguards for ++ here, it will let us
walk off the list if we're not careful. An iterator
is actually its own class associated here with . </p>

<p>To point to the last item in the container? 
end() exists but points <em>just past</em> the last item
in the container. This will let us go through
everything <em>including</em> the last item, letting
us do stuff with the last item. </p>

<p>To point to the last item: </p>

<pre><code>it = myVec.end();

it--; // Decrement once to last item
      // Assumes list empty 
</code></pre>

<p>This lets us loop easily: </p>

<pre><code>while (it != myVec.end())
{
    cout &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; endl; 

    // This assumes we've defined how
    // cout should handle our items in the list

    it++; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>end() could be pointing to a dummy node, for example. </p>

<p>If we have an STL container of another class-type,
we'll need </p>

<pre><code>(*iterator).method(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Because precedence(*) &gt; precedence(.)
So we can use the <code>-&gt;</code> operator as well. </p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> operators have been overloaded. 
Iterators can be treated like pointers, but it is
not possible to do something like <code>begin() - end()</code></p>

<p>For EVERY STL container, the data-type held in
the container must have a default constructor. </p>

<p>Can we have derived classes of CSProfessor
and MathProfessor derived from Person. Can we then 
have a  of Persons and then have those items
set equal to a Professor? No, because polymorphism 
is only usable with pointers or references. We could
have a  of Person pointers. </p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
    ...
};

class Derived1 : public Base
{
    ...
};

class Derived2 : public Base
{
    ...
};

list&lt;Base&gt; x; 

Derived1 y;
</code></pre>

<p>Can we do: </p>

<pre><code>x.push_back(y); 
</code></pre>

<p>This would compile but it is not something
we should do. Only put stuff that belongs
into a . </p>

<p>But we do: </p>

<pre><code>list&lt;Base*&gt; x; // List of Base pointers

Derived1 y; 

x.push_back(&amp;y); // ADDRESS-OF y 
</code></pre>

<p>For iterators, we can compare equality
if they point into the same container. Only
 allows for comparing vector's &lt; &gt;, etc. </p>

<p>Try overloading the <code>*</code> operator for our own 
 class. </p>

<p>For a , use an iterator because we wanted
to insert something in the middle. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-const-iterators" class="anchor" href="#const-iterators" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Const Iterators</h5>

<p>IF we pass in a container by constant reference,
we CANNOT use a regular iterator. The regular
iterator has the ability to modify the item
it points to. Instead, we must use a <em>const iterator</em>.
We'll see: <code>cannot convert...const_iterator...iterator</code></p>

<pre><code>void tickleNerds(const list&lt;string&gt;&amp; nerds)
{
    list&lt;string&gt;::const_iterator it; 
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Const iterators let us iterate through stuff,
but we won't be able to modify the stuff its points at.
This enforces the const promise we made.  </p>

<p>begin() returns an iterator to the first item;
end() returns an iterator to a place right below
the last item.</p>

<p>front() and back() return the first and last values.</p>

<p>What is an iterator? It is an object that
knows what it points to and how to go forward or backward.</p>

<p>// Amazing how much Carey's glasses and baldness are reminiscent
// of Steve Jobs</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-summary-of--2" class="anchor" href="#summary-of--2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary of </h4>

<p> lets us associate two related values,
just like what we did with our previous homework. </p>

<p>This one works likke:</p>

<pre><code>map&lt;string,int&gt; nameToPhone; 

nameToPhone["Carey"] = 325239834;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that a map can only associate in a single
direction, e.g. string --&gt; int, not string &lt;--&gt; int</p>

<p>To go the reverse direction, we would need
a separate .</p>

<p>To access a specific element at some position,
use an iterator. </p>

<p>It works by creating a struct (e.g. Pair)
that stores two items, of the types specified
via template when we created the Map.</p>

<p>To map something to many things: </p>

<pre><code>map&lt;string, vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; myMap; 
</code></pre>

<p>To find a previously-added association,
use an iterator. </p>

<pre><code>map&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator it; 
</code></pre>

<p>Then call the find() function; find() can
only by used to find by the first item:</p>

<pre><code>it = nameToAge.find("Carey"); 
// Binary search tree is used
</code></pre>

<p>We can also look at the Pair of values
in the item in the Map pointers to by
the iterator:</p>

<pre><code>it-&gt;first;
it-&gt;second; 
</code></pre>

<p>What if the looked-for item doesn't exist?
It returns an iterator that points to end().</p>

<p>A Map can only map from a single item, e.g. 
the first item cannot be a vector, but the second
item can be. </p>

<pre><code>if (it == nameToAge.end())
    cout &lt;&lt; "Not found!\n"; 
</code></pre>

<p>To iterate through: </p>

<pre><code>for (it = myMap.begin; it != myMap.end(); it++)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maps always maintain their items in alphabetical 
order and are sorted automatically by the first
parameter, i.e. by the first parameter to map,
and the map will be sorted by blah, e.g. by strings. </p>

<p>Note that we <em>must define an operator <code>&lt;</code> for the left-hand</em>
class/struct! Why? Because maps automatically sort 
stuff that we add to them. If we do not do this,
we will get a syntax error. </p>

<p>Within the map, we compare new Pairs via the first
parameter. How does this all work using just the &lt; operator? </p>

<p>To see if they're equal: !(a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; !(b &lt; a)</p>

<p>The map will is thus able to determine &gt; and ==. </p>

<p>Why do we use Maps? It allows for more encapsulation, 
for associating stuff on the fly, etc. We could always do 
class composition, but that takes a lot of work. </p>

<p>The first parameter to a  MUST be a single item,
but that single item could contain other data structures,
including vectors, etc. We would just need to more work with
the &lt; operator.</p>

<p>If we do something like <code>map&lt;int, Stud&gt;</code>, then Stud
no longer needs a &lt; operator here. </p>

<p>Create a set: </p>

<pre><code>set&lt;data_type&gt; mySet; 
</code></pre>

<p>A set keeps a set of unique items
and ignores duplicates when inserting. </p>

<pre><code>insert()
erase()
size()
</code></pre>

<p>Are the items ordered? Yes, they are ordered
smaller to bigger, and we would <em>need an &lt; operator</em>
for an item held in a . This allows for ordering,
needed for binary search. Sets are binary search trees. </p>

<p>We can have sets of other data types. </p>

<p>To search through a set: </p>

<pre><code>set&lt;data_type&gt;::iterator it; 

it = mySet.find(...);

if (it == mySet.end()) // Sentinel value
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Not found!" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All items will be alphabetically ordered. </p>

<p>To erase, we can pass in an iterator;
this lets us delete specific items.</p>

<pre><code>it = mySet.find("Doomed"); 

mySet.erase(it); 

// The iterator is now INVALID
// Don't dereference it! 
</code></pre>

<p>This does NOT erase the iterator, only the
item that we point to. For sets, we can erase
by value or by iterator. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-iterator-gotchas" class="anchor" href="#iterator-gotchas" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Iterator Gotchas</h5>

<p>If we have an iterator that points into 
a  and we then add/remove items from the
vector, then we <em>must</em> consider the iterator <em>invalid</em>.
Remember: this is <em>undefined behavior</em>.  </p>

<p>This applies to any iterators pointing into the
vector <em>before</em> the add/remove operation(s)&gt; </p>

<p>This comes from how vectors are dynamic arrays and may
be creating a new dynamic array. The old iterator
pointed at the old dynamic array though, which was freed
from memory. </p>

<p>To erase an item in a  (not via pop_back),
do it via an iterator--but then forget about any other
iterator that was pointing into that vector!</p>

<p>QUESTION: Do  ever downsize? Implementation-dependent.
There are multiple versions of the STL. Also,
never subclass any STL stuff. That'd be crazy.</p>

<p>This is not a problem with sets, lists, or maps. 
HOWEVER: IF we erase the item that an iterator points to, 
then the iterator is invalid. Re-assign the iterator. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-stl-algorithms" class="anchor" href="#stl-algorithms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STL Algorithms</h4>

<p>There is a separate find() function that can search
most containers and arrays for a value. </p>

<p>set_intersection() finds the intersection of two sets. </p>

<p>To do all this: <code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;</code></p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-find" class="anchor" href="#find" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>find()</h5>

<p>First argument is an iterator where we want to start
searching. Second argument is an iterator that points
just after where we want to stop searching. 
third argument is what we want to find. </p>

<p>find() returns an iterator to the item. </p>

<p>It could not find it, it will return whatever we passed
in for the second parameter (which might not be the end()
if we've narrowed down the search area). </p>

<p>This is a linear search. </p>

<pre><code>list&lt;string&gt; names; 

a = names.begin(); 
b = names.end();

itr = find(a, b, "Judy"); 
</code></pre>

<p>find() will not look at b; it will only examine
b - 1. </p>

<p>On an array, find will return a pointer
or the value of the second parameter:</p>

<pre><code>int* ptr; 

// Address-of a[4] means we only want to look
// up to a[3]; a[4] could be after the array
ptr = find(&amp;a[0], &amp;a[4], 19);
</code></pre>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-find_if" class="anchor" href="#find_if" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>find_if()</h5>

<p>find_if() will loop through a container/array and
passes each item to a <em>predicate function</em> that we specify. </p>

<p>Again, first item, and place after last item. </p>

<p>The predicate function must return a boolean. </p>

<pre><code>int* ptr;

ptr = find_if(&amp;a[0], &amp;a[4], is_even);
</code></pre>

<p>find_if() will return a pointer to the item
if is_even() returns true and is done. Else, 
it moves onto the next item and passes a[n] into 
the predicate function. </p>

<p>The predicate function must take the item of the type 
in the array or container,and must return a boolean.</p>

<p>This all works by using <em>function pointers</em>. </p>

<p>find_if() lets us locate items meeting specific 
requirements. </p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-sort" class="anchor" href="#sort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>sort()</h5>

<p>first one is the first item, and second one
is just after the last item:</p>

<pre><code>sort(item.begin, item.end());

<p>To sort other items, we'll need a &lt; operator. </p>

<p>Example: algo A takes 5*N^2 instructions for an input of N data</p>

<ol>
<li>We can compare for a given size of input</li>
<li>We can predict the performance of these algos when applied to
less or more data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Big-O approach measures by the <em>gross number of steps</em> that
is requires for a size N input in the <strong>worst-case scenario</strong>.</p>

<p>We could be specific:</p>

<p>"This algo takes 5N^2 + 3N + 20 instructions to process N items."</p>

<p>With Big-O, we approximate, by ignoring the coefficients and
the lower-order terms. We would simply say, "The Big-O of
this algo is N^2". This a quick, overall impression of algo's
worst-case efficiency. </p>

<p>STORY TIME:</p>

<p>He saw a food fight, back when he was in Sproul Hall, senior year, 
but no one was throwing food, but all of a sudden,
some guys who had been mock-throwing food from the salad
bar began an actual food-fight. </p>

<p>We use simple functions like log(n), n, n^2, nlog(n). </p>

<p>We would say O(n^2) as "O of n squared" or 
"O of nlog2(N)" (it's always assumed to be log base 2 in CS). </p>

<a id="user-content-computing-big-o" class="anchor" href="#computing-big-o" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computing Big-O</h3>

<p>We need to determine the number of operations
an algo performs, f(n), this is NOT Big O. </p>

<p>Operations: </p>

<ol>
<li>Accessing an item</li>
<li>Evaluating a math expression</li>
<li>Traversing a single link in a linked list, etc. </li>
</ol>

<p>See the PowerPoint for examples. </p>

<p>We initialize, so one operation, we compare
n and i N times, we increment N times, 
we initialize the inner loop counter n times
(because of the outer loop), we compare n^2 comparisons. </p>

<p>If we wanted to compare two algo's with the same Big-O,
we would compare them at the specific data sizes we're
going to deal with, likely.</p>

<p>// York Peppermint Pattys today</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine f(n) [the number of steps required to solve a problem,
in terms of the number of items n]</li>
<li>Keep the most signficant term and toss the rest</li>
<li>Remove any constant multiplier</li>
<li>This is our Big O, "O of blah"</li>
</ol>

<p>// Note that nlog2(n) &gt; c*n for large n</p>

<p>Why do we toss constants? Because we're typically dealing with
far more stark contrasts, e.g. nlog2(n) vs n^4</p>

<p>We're focusing on the <em>most frequently-occuring operations</em>. </p>

<p>So to find Big-O, just find the thing that happens the most often,
and see how many steps it takes, in terms of the size of the
input data. </p>

<p>Assume that we're analyzing for very large N; this makes
the significant term obvious. </p>

<p>When we say O(n^2), "O of n squared", means
"This algo takes roughly n^2 operations to process N items." </p>

<p>For very large data-sets, there is a vast difference between
n^2, nlog2(n), n, etc. There can also be a O(constant),
meaning we always take a certain constant number of steps
for any data size. </p>

<p>It turns out that we cannot sort a set of data in less
than nlog2(n) time.</p>

<p>We're almost always gonna get </p>

<p>log2(N), N, Nlog2(N), N^2, N^3, 2^N, N! [this last one is horrible]</p>

<p>log2(N) is screamingly fast, much like binary search 
(if something is already sorted). </p>

<p>The choice of algorithms makes all the difference in the world.
Big-O time complexity means that we should always look for something
that is fundamentally better. </p>

<p>There is NOT a big difference between 5N^3 and 1.5N^3. </p>

<p>N^3 is terrible though. This is a USC graduate that stopped drinking
so much. A UCLA graduate would find something that does it
in Nlog2(N). Carey cites this difference in approach as the
differnece between CS-educated software engineers and self-taught coders.</p>

<p>We could write something that checks the size of an input
and then uses the best algo for that data size. </p>

<p>Note that for small data-sets, there is little difference between
algos. Use the easiest, least-buggy implementation. BUT for large
data-sets, use the most efficient algo.</p>

<p>"Don't sweat the small stuff." </p>

<p><em>Do not prematurely optimize a program</em>. Optimize a program
once it works.</p>

<p>Big-O's origin for its name? It was originally a capital omicron
and used by number theorists, apparently. </p>

<p>Big means capital, with O meaning order of complexity, apparently. </p>

<p>Jackie: "Big O might as well mean Oprah." </p>

<p>// Earlier, at the beginning of lecture: 
// "Has anyone here learned Big O before?" 
// I thought he'd say, "Has anyone here had a Big O before?"</p>

<p>Question: If I have an algo, does a less efficient algo
consume more energy? </p>

<p>Smallberg is here! And he sorta knew why Big O was called
Big O, haha, exactly as Carey predicted. </p>

<p>For the power consumption thing, Google worries about this, 
because their data centers consumes that much electricity. 
Their optimizations save them millions in electricity costs all the time. </p>

<p>Smallberg: "So are you saying that..."</p>

<p>Carey: "Oh dear..."</p>

<p>"Don't cause trouble..."</p>

<p>From example: For each n steps, we're gonna do n^2 steps, so O(n^3).</p>

<p>Anything that divides stuff in half, we're prolly gonna have
a log2(n) in there somewhere. </p>

<p>It's a good thing that I have many of my (2^x)'s memorized
for small-enough x's, haha. </p>

<p>Typically, we're always splitting stuff up in some way, </p>

<p>All logs are proportional to each other, so the log base
doesn't matter that much. </p>

<p>The guy scratched a ticket. He just won $10,000?!
No, Carey trolled him! </p>

<p>"Prizes may be claimed at Yo Mama's..."</p>

<p>OMG, Carey is too funny, haha. </p>

<p>Basically, multiplication is repeated addition. </p>

<p>We repeat something N times, then N times, then N times,
we to get the total: N * k, where k might N again or
log2(N), etc. </p>

<p>What if we had n^3 + n^2? Big-O ignores the lower-order
terms; if we see two loops, just look at the larger one. </p>

<p>To place something at the end of an array? O(1) or O(constant). </p>

<p>"O of some constant" is really, really nice. </p>

<p>"You know what you won? Nothing!" </p>

<p>0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) is n * (n - 1) / 2</p>

<p>n * n - n / 2 --&gt; n^2 for Big O</p>

<p>Shortcut steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Locate all loops that do NOT run a fixed number of iterations,
and determine their <em>max number of iterations</em></p></li>
<li><p>Turn these loops into loops with a fixed number of iterations,
using their max number of iterations, e.g. replace i with n - 1 --&gt; n.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Inner loops that compare against their outer loop counter
may run a variable number of items.</p>

<p>Just replace the variable thing with the max number of iterations. </p>

<ol>
<li>Declare your big O. </li>
</ol>

<p>"O of N [blah]" </p>

<p>If we have something in terms of Q, we would say O(Q^4),
"O of Q to the fourth". It makes no sense to define a function
in terms of </p>

<p>If we have:</p>

<pre><code>for ( i &lt; n )
    for ( j &lt; i * i)
        for (k &lt; j)
</code></pre>

<p>Then this is O(n^5), as we had n * n^2 * n^2</p>

<p>O(p^4)</p>

<p><strong>Check what the loops' terminating conditions are</strong></p>

<p>"What would you do if you didn't have fear?"</p>

<pre><code>for (j &lt; N)
    Circ arr[N];
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we create an array of N circles (we call the constructor N times),
N times, so O(n^2). </p>

<p>In the loop, we construct N times, and destruct N times, so that's
2N times. This is assuming that the Circle constructor's is done in O(constant) time</p>

<p>An array of integers would not take this much time though; 
that would be a constant-time operation because all the compiler
would do is allocate memory for the array, but not initialize anything. </p>

<p>What about multi-input algos? They take in two arguments, independent
of each other. </p>

<p>We could end up with a Big-O time complexity of O(n * q). </p>

<p>// QUESTION: What if we had related arguments? Would things just be </p>

<p>Because the inputs are unrelated, one or the other might dominate,
so we could have O(n + q). </p>

<p>Often, we have <code>+</code> when we have independent loops 
(or separate iterations of some sort), 
and <code>*</code> when we have nested loops (or iteration within iteration).</p>

<pre><code>for (i &lt; N)
{
    if (i == N/2)
        for (k &lt; Q)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Big-O time complexity? N + Q, because only once for every 
every value of N do we have i == N/2, which means we only do
an inner loop operation Q times total. So N + Q. </p>

<p>In the average case, a  can insert

<p>He was in India, at the Bombay Airport,
waiting in line, trying to get into the airport. </p>

<p>His boss is behind him, and jittery, as he hates travel. 
He misheard "passport" as "password", so Carey replied
"open sesame", HAHA. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>set&lt;int&gt; nums;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; q; i++)
    nums.insert( i );
</code></pre>

<p>Inserting is normally log2(q), but the set begins
empty, and increases in size. For Big-O, evaluate the worst-case,
which is that we need to assume that nums will hold q items.</p>

<p>So each time we insert, it takes log2(q) steps. Then we
repeat this q times to insert q items. </p>

<p>If something is changing size, just assume that it's the biggest
it can be, then evaluate from there on. We're assuming that it
always has the maximum number of items it can have, as Big-O
looks at the <em>worst case</em>. </p>

<p>Carey: "I don't have any napkins, so you can just use your shirt." </p>

<p>For set s, int n:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n * n; i++)
{
    s.insert(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The answer is O(n^2log2(n^2)) or O(n^2log2(n)),
because the exponent inside the log can be taken
out as a constant. </p>

<p>Now, we have a vector&lt; set &gt; v</p>

<p>v with N sets, and each set has Q items.</p>

<p>"Do you want a waffle?"
"I already had breakfast." </p>

<p>Quite a few people actually turning down the
waffles today. xD</p>

<p>What about number of even values in all of v ?</p>

<p>N * Q, because we have to go through every set in 
the vector. There are N sets, with Q items in each. </p>

<p>"You know what that sounds like? Wrong." </p>

<p>"Just Q?! That's worth a prize ticket--that's ballsy."</p>

<p>How about finding the first set with a particular value
and then counting the number of even values in that set? </p>

<p>N * log2(Q) + Q [N or Q may dominate; need to include both terms]</p>

<p>We may have to go through all the sets, and then once
we find the set, we have to go through all the Q items
to count all the evens. </p>

<p>Evens-counting is O(Q) and not O(log2(Q)) because there's
no built-in function for doing so in log2(Q) time; it has
to be done linearly instead with an iterator. </p>

<p>We (+) Q because we only do the even-counting once. </p>

<p>Do NOT use multiplication unless something is done to

<h3>
<a id="user-content-sorting" class="anchor" href="#sorting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sorting</h3>

<p>Sorting is the process of ordering a bunch of items
based on one or more rules, subject to one or more constraints.</p>

<p>We can sort just about anything; the number of items to be sorted
is <em>important</em>; this affects our sort choice. Large data-sets
require efficient sorting algos. </p>

<p>We need to figure out how to sort something, e.g. by
first name, last name, and then GPA. </p>

<p>Constraints: Are the items in RAM or on disk? E.g., if
we're sorting through Facebook's archives, and we need to sort
chunks at a time. Are we dealing with something that can be fit
in memory all at once? </p>

<p>What data container holds the data? </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-rules" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Do NOT choose a sorting algo until we understand
the requirements of a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Always choose the simplest sorting algo possible
that meets our requirements. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-selection-sort" class="anchor" href="#selection-sort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Selection Sort</h3>

<p>This is slow, and not used often in practice, 
but it'll come up in interviews. </p>

<p>Say we have a bunch of books on a self that we 
want to order ascending based on size of the spine. </p>

<p>First, we find the shortest book in the N size group.</p>

<p>We swap this with the first book.
Then, we look at the remaining N - 1 books and select
the shortest, and swap it with the second book. </p>

<p>Continue this until everything is sorted. </p>

<p>There is no n! algo that we would ever want to use. </p>

<p>Time complexity? <strong>O(n^2)</strong></p>

<p>A step is any time we swap or point our finder at a book. </p>

<p>How do we arrive at O(n^2)? We're simplifying by assuming
N swap steps, and then we have N + N -1 + N - 2+ ... 
--&gt; N * (N+1)/2 --&gt; N^2</p>

<p>When is it more or less efficient? What if something 
is already in order or mostly in order? </p>

<p>Selection sort will still be just as slow. It'll 
still go through everything because it doesn't know for sure
that the first item really is the smallest one in the array
of items. </p>

<p>On the final exam, we'll be asked something like:
"What will this array look like after two iterations
of a selection sort?" </p>

<p>Does a selection sort work well for a linked list? 
Sure! We can easily traverse a list, and the pointer-nature
of nodes means we have an easy time swapping values
between stuff. Note that we'd be changing what node we start
at each time, which is easy, as we'd simply have simple 
pointer to the starting node for examination, and then we could
simply follow that pointer to the next node for the next iteration. </p>

<p>Note that recursion is atypical for selection sort. </p>

<p>Is a selection sort <em>stable</em> or <em>unstable</em>?</p>

<p>We have a comedy show for the break.</p>

<p>"Don't say anything inappropriate or take off your clothes." </p>

<a id="user-content-stable-vs-unstable-sorting" class="anchor" href="#stable-vs-unstable-sorting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stable vs. Unstable Sorting</h3>

<p>This is not mental instability. </p>

<p>N old people line up to buy laxatives.</p>

<p>"Anybody need a definiiton for laxatives?"</p>

<p>The drugstore wants to sort them and serve them
based on urgency. </p>

<p>"Who hasn't pooped in the longest time?" </p>

<p>Then need to choose a sorting algo
that'll do things in a descending manner. </p>

<p>An <em>unstable</em> sorting algo re-orders
the items without taking into account their initial
ordering. E.g., Ebenezer was originally first in line,
but ended up 3rd in line. This is because everyone was
sorted based on the number of days they haven't ordered;
the sort didn't care about the original line order. </p>

<p>"Andrea's my mom by the way. That would be really embarrassing." </p>

<p>A <em>stable</em> sort takes into account the initial order
and maintains the initial order for items that tie based 
on the sorting criteria. </p>

<p>If you forget, just remember the <em>laxatives</em>!</p>

<p>So is a selection sort stable or unstable? 
Stable. We don't swap out the first item unless
we find a value smaller/larger than it later
in the list of stuff (depends on the sorting order). </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-insertion-sort" class="anchor" href="#insertion-sort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Insertion Sort</h3>

<p>We use this commonly to sort playing cards. </p>

<p>With books: </p>

<p>Focus on the first two books. If the last
book in this set is in the wrong order,
remove it from the sehlf, shfift the books before it right
as needed, and keep comparing the remove book with the shifted
books, and insert it back into the proper slot.</p>

<p>We start with a size of two, and increase our set size,
shifting books as needed. </p>

<p>Start with size s = 2.</p>

<p>While there are still books to sort: </p>

<pre><code>Focus on the first s books

If the last book is out of order

Remove it

Shift the books before it to the right

insert our book into the proper slot

s = s + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Breaking ties depends on our comparison. </p>

<p>For Big-O. We may shift up to one book for round
one. For round two, this might be two books. </p>

<p>During the last round: N - 1 shifts t to find the
right spot (we're assuming insertion is done in 
constant time). </p>

<p>This is roughly <strong>O(N^2)</strong> steps overall.</p>

<p>If all the books are all already in the right order, 
then insertion sort never does any shifting, and will
take O(n) time to figure this out. This is the best
case for insertion sort. </p>

<p>A perfectly mis-ordered set (i.e. reverse of our intended
order), will take N^2 steps. </p>

<p>See the PowerPoint for the implementation code. </p>

<p>Is this a stable sort? This depends on the implementation;
by default, it is generally stable, as it won't move something
unless necessary. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-bubble-sort" class="anchor" href="#bubble-sort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bubble Sort</h3>

<p>Everyone loves to make fun of bubble sort. </p>

<p>Start the atop element of the array. </p>

<p>If the first two elements are out of order, 
swap them.</p>

<p>Then advance forward, a[1] and a[2]. Compare them,
if so, swap, then advance again, all the way till
the end of the array. </p>

<p>IN essence: check two items at a time.</p>

<p>If we made any swaps, repeat the whole process. </p>

<p>Example: celebrities sorted based on the number
of times they've been in rehab. </p>

<p>The smaller items "bubble" up toward te top. </p>

<p>Mentioning bubble sort would likely cause the interviewer
to laugh. </p>

<p>Bubble sort has a bad (bubble) "wrap"</p>

<p>During each pass, we compare every element with its successor,
N steps, and we if made any swaps, we may have to repeat this
process, which means in the worst case we'll do
N passes of N bubbles --&gt; N^2</p>

<p>Bubble sort is <strong>O(N^2)</strong></p>

<p>What if the data is already in order? <strong>O(N)</strong> to find out that
the data is already in order. </p>

<p>Ask the interviewer: Does the provided algo terminate
after making no swaps, or does it always go for N^2 times? </p>

<p>Final exam: We'll be given an array partially sorted, and
we'll be asked: "Which sort did this?" </p>

<p>Every sort is different. The results are distinguishable. </p>

<p>Is bubble sort stable? Yes. We don't move stuff unless we
necessary. </p>

<p>"The Lion Sleeps Tonight" --&gt; Sorting dance, haha. </p>

<p>How to tell stuff apart (after one round of sorting): </p>

<p>Selection sort: Is the smallest item in the first slot? </p>

<p>Insertion sort: Is the second item smaller than the first item?</p>

<p>Bubble sort: Are the last two items out of order? </p>

<p>Note that bubble sort will always leave the biggest number
in the last slot after the first iteration. Then on the second
iteration, the two biggest numbers will be there, and so on. </p>

<p>h-sorting underlies shell sorting. </p>

<p>Pick a value for h (some positive whole number)</p>

<p>Compare a[i] and a[i + h];
    if they are out of order
    Swap tem
If we swapped any items, repeat the whole process again</p>

<p>Bubble sort is basically an h-sort with a value of h = 1</p>

<p>A higher h-value does not make h-sort more efficient.
An array that is h-sorted may not be truly sorted (unless h = 1). 
All h-sort does is guarantee that the i item is less
than the i + h item. </p>

<p>So we'd compare first item and fourth item, 
then second item and fith item (h = 3).
Then here, every item is less than the item 3 places
away from it. It would be "3-sorted".</p>

<a id="user-content-shellsort" class="anchor" href="#shellsort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shellsort</h4>

<p>Pick a sequence of <em>decreasing</em> h-values ending with
an h-value of 1: e.g. 8, 4, 2, 1</p>

<p>There have been many attempts to figure out the best 
sequence.</p>

<p><strong>It is required that we end with h = 1</strong>. 
This guarantees that stuff actually gets sorted.</p>

<p>How does it work? We h1-sort, then h2-sort, then
h3-sort, etc. </p>

<p>Example: 8-sort, then 4-sort, then 2-sort, then 1-sort
(bubble sort). </p>

<p>Common pattern: exponential-decreasing h-values. </p>

<p>With each h-sort, we're making the array more sorted each
time for the next sorting pass, so the end result is less
than O(n^2) [the Big-O for bubble sort]. </p>

<p>Can this be applied easily to a linked list? 
Sure: Santo had the idea of having two separate pointers. </p>

<p>We simply advance the pointers, with the starting 
difference being the h-value.</p>

<p>Shell sort is estimated to have a time complexity of
~<strong>O(N^1.25)</strong>. It's usually used on low-memory run environments,
as it uses little memory. </p>

<p>But first, an STL challenge: </p>

<p>std::map &gt; habitationHistory;</p>

<p>P people, with E former streets. </p>

<p>Finding the names of all people who lives on levering street? 
Assuming we have a set. <em>P * log2(E)</em>. We have to go through
all the people and then check their set of former addresses.</p>

<p>Bill ever lived on Westwood? <em>log2(P) + log2(E)</em>. 
We find the right person, then we check if the that street
is in their history. </p>

<p>Print out every name with each person's streets, in alpha order. 
<em>P * E</em>. We go through every person and then through
all their streets.  or a  is already in order. </p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, on to <strong>quicksort</strong> and *<em>mergesort</em>, 
the divide-and-conquer algorithms. There are known 
as the efficient sorts and are the ones we normally
use in regular software engineering. </p>

<p>In general, they work like this: </p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>Divide</em> the data-set into two groups of roughly equal size</li>
<li>Sort each of these sub-sets (<em>conquer</em>)</li>
<li>Combine the two sorted groups into one large sorted list
(Line up your conquered enemies and make them watch you
listen to you gloat about your victory.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice how this is perfect for <em>recursion</em>!</p>

<p>Quicksort works like this (what we did a previous homework
assignment without realizing it): </p>

<ol>
<li>If the array contains only 0 or 1 element, return</li>
<li>Select an arbitrary element P (pivot) from the array (typically the first one)</li>
<li>Move all elements that are <em>less than or equal to P</em> to the left 
of the array and all elements <em>greater than P</em> to the right. 
This is <em>partioning</em> (divide), and is what split() did in our homework. 
Note that the elements on either side are not in order (at this point). 
They're just less than or greater than the pivot value. </li>
<li>Recursively repeat this process on the left sub-array and on the right sub-array
This is the <em>conquer</em> step. Why do operate on the sub-arrays and forget
about the pivot? Because it's already in the right spot! Everything to the
left and to the right is out of order, but the pivot value fits between them.
Note however that the pivot value will not always end up in the middle
once the array is sorted. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that we could reverse this so that larger ends up on the left, and
and smaller on the left. Note that this sort is <em>unstable</em>, as ties do not
maintain their original order. </p>

<p>In more advanced algos, multiple values are picked randomly, find the median 
element, and then use that (since it's closer to the true median value). </p>

<p>In code: </p>

<pre><code>void quickSort(int array[], int first, int last)
{
    if (last - first &gt;= 1)
    {
        int pivotIndex;

            // Divide!

        pivotindex = partition(array, first, first);

            // Conquer!

        // Left side; don't touch the pivotValue again
        quickSort(array, first, pivotIndex - 1); 

        // Right side; don't touch the pivotValue again
        quickSort(arary, pivotIndex + 1, last); 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See split() in the homework, which modified parameters to let us know
what the partition values were. </p>

<p>partition() will actually complete in O(n) time. Why? Because its
low and high trackers are checked to see if low ever exceeds high,
which would mean we hit the end. </p>

<p>Note also how the pivotValue may not end up in the exact middle. </p>

<hr>

<p>What's the Big-O of quicksort? Well, we go through the array
to partion it, which takes N steps, then we repeat this for each half.
The number of halves? log2(N) [2 ^ what power is equal to the size of the data-set?]</p>

<p>For each iteration, we partition, costing N steps, then we partition 
the halves, N/2 and N/2. Then four arrays, partitioned at a cost of
N/4 + N/4 + N/4 + N/4. N steps! </p>

<p>So, we take N steps each time to partition (as we just showed), 
and we repeat this log2(N) times (the number of halves we can
make till we hit just 1 or 0 items left [our base case]) in a subarray. </p>

<p>So, quicksort's average Big-O is <strong>O(nlog2(n))</strong></p>

<p><em>However</em>, quicksort is very slow for a set of data that is 
already sorted or mostly sorted. Then, the partitioning hardly
moves anything around but still takes N steps anyway. Then, 
when we recursively do this, there is no left or right side. 
The problem reduction is minimal, so the "problem" is solved slowly. </p>

<p>We repeat this process N times (no split), and each time we partition,
we take N times, so it takes N^2 now.</p>

<p>Then, the algo will only lop off item off the side each time,
and then repeat this N items, for N partitions each time.
This problem also comes up with data that is in reverse order.</p>

<p>So quicksort's worst-case Big-O is <strong>O(n^2)</strong></p>

<p>AVOID quicksort for data that is already mostly or completely
sorted, or in (mostly) reverse order (everything gets moved
to one side [no splitting]). </p>

<p>For an array of N items, which has N! possible configurations,
quicksort is nlog2(n) for most of the configurations
(which would be out of order). </p>

<p>Quicksort works well with a doubly-linked list as we can go up
and down easily. It is an <em>unstable</em> sort, because the pivot
pick is rather random, and we might end up moving stuff around. </p>

<p>In terms of memory usage, quicksort's RAM requirements vary
and can be memory-intensive.</p>

<p>Can it be parallelized across multiple cores? Yes: once the
partioning happens, the subsets can be given to different cores,
which can distribute again if we have a lot of cores. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-mergesort" class="anchor" href="#mergesort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mergesort</h3>

<p>Merge takes <em>pre-sorted</em> ararays as inputs and outputs a combined
third sorted array. We learned this as the Lazy Person's Sort.</p>

<p>The underlying basic merge algo: </p>

<p>Take the left-most book in both shelves. 
move the the smallest book to the new, third shelf. </p>

<p>In other words: go through both arrays, compare their 
corresponding elements, and copy over the smaller/larger value
into the third result array 
(depending on if we want ascending or descending). </p>

<p>If either array runs, copy over the entire 
remaining contents of the other array (they're guaranteed 
to belong there, since the arrays are pre-sorted). </p>

<p>We can take a single array and split using different
indices trackers (assuming the tracked parts are already
sorted into two parts, and we know where those parts begin). </p>

<p>Once all this is done, we copy over the contents of the
third, temporary array into the original input array. 
Delete the temporary array. </p>

<p>Full mergesort algo: </p>

<ol>
<li>If array has 1 element, base case: return</li>
<li>Split array into two equal section3</li>
<li>Recursively call mergeSort on left half</li>
<li>Recursively call mergeSort on right half</li>
<li>Call basicMerge to combine the resulting halves</li>
</ol>

<p>The base case is 1 and NOT 2, because the two items
might be out of order, which basicMerge would take care of. </p>

<p>// Many people are missing from the class today, haha,
// likely on account of Project 3</p>

<p><strong>Look to the UCSF visualization of sorts</strong></p>

<p>// Holy cow, Carey's calendar is ridiculous! 
// One way to keep programming: do just enough
// to get more money but not be promoted</p>

<hr>

<p>STORY TIME: </p>

<p>Back when Carey was an intern at Symantec, he
was analyzing DOS viruses. The company wasn't as
strict back then. Everything is kept locked up
in a lab. But back then, he was allowed to login
remotely and copy files back and forth to get some
work done. So he had a virus on the computer on 
work computer, on the gateway, and he was about to 
transfer it back, but he wrote "copy [blah]" but
this automatically ran the copy.exe virus on the gateway
computer. He realized this, and tried to manually clean
up the gateway. He does so. His colleague: 
"Dude, you infected the entire network!" </p>

<p>Every computer is running a scan of Norton and every file 
is coming up infected. He fears being fired and going to jail.
He's crying. His boss apparently pulled a joke. A scan found
the infection right away and removed it. They made a joke definition
that would detect every file, and so it made look like everything 
was infected. </p>

<hr>

<p>NOTE: mergeSort works in-place, all within the array,
except for basicMerge() part, which requires a temporary array. </p>

<p>Big-O analysis time: </p>

<p>The maximum number of levels for mergeSort? log2(N). 
What about the merging cost? We merge a total of N items
at the bottom (halves + halves + halves + ...)</p>

<p>At the second-to-bottom level, it also takes N steps. </p>

<p>At every level, we merge N items. </p>

<p>So mergeSort() is always <strong>O(nlog2(n))</strong></p>

<p>Why would we choose quickSort() over mergeSort()? </p>

<p>Because mergeSort() requires allocation of temporary 
containers (in fact, double the memory)!</p>

<p>quickSort() does not require that. </p>

<p>mergeSort() caveats? No, regardless of how items are
arranged. The time and memory cost comes from allocating
temporary containers for basicMerge()</p>

<p>Is this easy for a linked list? Yes, just follow the links, 
swap values as needed. </p>

<p>It is a <em>stable</em> sort. Are there are any special uses for mergeSort()
that other sorts can't handle? Yes: if we have large datasets
split across multiple hard-drives, then mergeSort() is perfect for it,
since reading/writing to HDDs is slow. </p>

<p>It can totally be parallelized across mulitiple cores, though
basicMerge() must be done under a single core. </p>

<p>Look at the cheat sheet! </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-trees" class="anchor" href="#trees" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trees</h3>

<p>A special linked data structure that has many uses in CS. </p>

<p>It can manipulate hierarchical data, make information 
easily searchable, manipulate sorted lists, simplify 
expression evaluation, and make decisions (decision trees). </p>

<p>Time for some inappropriate. </p>

<p>Go back 32 levels from a person (32 generations),
we'll have ~ 4 billion. So go back far enough, and
it looks like everything is incest, haha. </p>

<p>Treets are made of nodes, with a <em>root pointer</em>,
analogous to the head pointer of lineked lists. 
The <em>root node</em>, pointed to by this root pointer, may have 0 or more 
children nodes. And so on for each of the children nodes. </p>

<p>Trees with two children for each node are called a binary tree.</p>

<p>A tree with no nodes is call an <em>empty tree</em>,
typically a base case. </p>

<p>A node with 0 children is called a <em>leaf node</em>.</p>

<p>If the root has no children, it is a root and a leaf.</p>

<p><em>Trees are linked lists with multiple forward pointers.</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-binary-trees" class="anchor" href="#binary-trees" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binary Trees</h3>

<p>A tree where every node has at most <em>two children nodes</em>. </p>

<p>With the exception of the root node, every node
has exactly one parent. Every two nodes descending
from the same parent node are called <em>sibling nodes</em>&gt; </p>

<p>An <em>ancestor node</em> is one which lies between the current node
and the root node, including the root. </p>

<p>Amongst the levels, we don't have links: if we did,
that'd be a <em>graph</em>.</p>

<p><em>Subtree</em>: Any node in the tree can be viewed as the root
of a smaller tree, a subtree. We'll use recursion to process
subtrees on either side of a binary tree. </p>

<p>"A binary tree is <em>bi</em>, not that bi"</p>

<p>Left and right sub-trees: If we pick a node from 
our tree, we can identify its left and right sub-trees. </p>

<p><em>Node depth</em> is the deptht of a node is the distance of a node
from the root of the tree, where the root has dept 0. </p>

<p><em>Full binary tree</em>: Every leaf has the same depth and every non-leaf
(not counting the root node)
has exactly two children. N depth, with 2^(n+1) - 1 nodes</p>

<p>Many operations are possible with a tree. We can add items,
delete items, search for something, 
remove a section of a tree (<em>pruning</em>) or add on a section (<em>grafting</em>). </p>

<p>To show that a child does not exist, use a <code>nullptr</code>.</p>

<a id="user-content-binary-tree-traversals" class="anchor" href="#binary-tree-traversals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binary Tree Traversals</h3>

<p>Any time we traverse through a tree, we always
<em>start with the root node</em>. </p>

<p>Four ways to do this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Pre-order</li>
<li>In-order</li>
<li>Post-order</li>
<li>Level-order</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-pre-order-traversal" class="anchor" href="#pre-order-traversal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pre-order Traversal</h4>

<p>It's recursive. </p>

<ol>
<li>Process the current node (add, print, etc.)</li>
<li>Process (recursively) the nodes in the left sub-tree</li>
<li>Process (recusrively) the nodes in the right sub-tree</li>
</ol>

<p>Why "pre-order"? Because the first thing we do
is we process in the value in the node <em>first</em>. </p>

<p>Dingleberry man visited to watch the lecture: "Carey on!"</p>

<pre><code>void preOrder(Node* cur)
{
    if (cur == nullptr)
        return; 

    cout &lt;&lt; cur-&gt;value; // Process the current node

    preOrder(cur-&gt;left); // Recusively process left sub-tree
    preOrder(cur-&gt;right); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the subtree process calls will NOT have knowledge of
the nodes above it. Instead, it's as before with recursion,
when recursively operating on an array meant we only had 
knowledge of our current subset of it. </p>

<p>Going to a leaf's child will give us a nullptr, 
meaning we process the leaves too (check if child pointer is nullptr
would skip leaves). </p>

<p>This is a depth-first search. It can also be done with a stack. </p>

<p>We visit every node ONCE, so traversal is O(N). </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-in-order-traversal" class="anchor" href="#in-order-traversal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In-Order Traversal</h4>

<ol>
<li>Process the nodes in the left sub-tree</li>
<li>Process the current node</li>
<li>Process the nodes in the right sub-tree</li>
</ol>

<p>Processing the current node happens <em>in-between</em>
processing the sub-trees. </p>

<p>Notice the order in which stuff gets printed out.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-post-order-travesal" class="anchor" href="#post-order-travesal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Post-Order Travesal</h4>

<ol>
<li>Process the nodes in the left sub-tree</li>
<li>Process the nodes in the right sub-tree</li>
<li>Process the current node</li>
</ol>

<p>We always go left-to-right on trees. </p>

<p>In-order used for binary search trees typically. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-level-order-traversal" class="anchor" href="#level-order-traversal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level-Order Traversal</h4>

<p>NOT recursive.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a temp pointer variable and queue of node pointers</li>
<li>Insert root node pointer into the pointer</li>
<li>While the queue is not empty:
A. Dequeue the top node and put it into temp
B. Process the node
C. Add the node's children to queue if they are not nullptr</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, what we did on the second midterm. </p>

<p>We visit each level's nodes, left to right, before going onto 
nodes in the next level. This results from the FIFO nature
of a queue. This one is a breadth-first search. </p>

<p>// Carey just asked us to pump up his BruinWalk score, haha. </p>

<p>Every traversal visits each node up to three times
(hit it, go left, return, go right, return), so they all
take <strong>O(n)</strong>. We don't skip nodes or skip branches. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-evaluating-expressions" class="anchor" href="#evaluating-expressions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluating Expressions</h3>

<p>Previously, we've done evaluation of postfix expressions. </p>

<p>Now, we can do arithmetic expressions with binary trees! </p>

<p>// I wonder about the steps required to get it all into the
// tree though. </p>

<p>CS 132 for compiler-writing, useful for evaluating expressions. 
Data structures come up again with compiler writing too. </p>

<p>Say we have something like this: </p>

<pre><code>        *
    +       -
  5   6   3   1
</code></pre>

<p>We begin with the root pointer and evaluate using
this general algo: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the current node is a number, return its value
(This is our base case)</p></li>
<li><p>Recursively evaluate the left sub-tree and get the result</p></li>
<li><p>Recursively evaluate the right sub-tree and get the result</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the operator in the current node to the left and right
results and return that.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a <em>post-order traversal</em>. </p>

<p>This could of course be generalized to any sort of operator/operation,
operating on many types of values. Our nodes could contain pointers
to functions, or have functions unto themselves, etc. Code is powerful.</p>

<p>This could work for boolean expressions too, where NOT would have a single
child. </p>

<p>Quick bit of code to do this: </p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Data&gt;
struct Node
{
    Data m_value; 
    Node* m_left; 
    Node* m_right; 
}


Data evaluate(Node* cur)
{
    if (isnum(m_value))
        return m_value;

<a id="user-content-binary-search-trees" class="anchor" href="#binary-search-trees" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binary Search Trees</h3>

<p>NOTE: Binary Tree is NOT a Binary Search Tree. </p>

<p>A BT has two children per node. A BST has ordered 
children per node. Read the problem VERY carefully. </p>

<p>BSTs were designed to rule search. </p>

<p>This is made possible by their structure:</p>

<p>For <em>any</em> given node in a BST:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All nodes in the <em>left</em> sub-tree must be <em>less</em> than 
the current node's value</p></li>
<li><p>All nodes in the <em>right</em> sub-tree must be <em>greater</em> than
the current node's value</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some special cases allow for &lt;= or &gt;= as well. </p>

<p>Note that BSTs are not always balanced. </p>

<p>Does this make a difference? Yes, it does. We'll see. </p>

<p>Are duplicates allowed? Depends on our needs. </p>

<p>We can choose to always place duplicates on the
left or right side, or have a third field in each
node that has a list of all the duplicates. </p>

<p>We can do many different things with BSTs: </p>

<ul>
<li>Check if it's empty</li>
<li>Search it for a value </li>
<li>Insert an item </li>
<li>Delete an item </li>
<li>Find the height of the tree</li>
<li>Traverse the binary tree (used for many of the above)</li>
<li>Free the memory used by the tree (a necessity!)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-searching-a-bst" class="anchor" href="#searching-a-bst" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Searching a BST</h4>

<p>To search a BST: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Begin at the root node</p></li>
<li><p>Continue forward until we hit a nullptr</p></li>
<li><p>If goal is == current node's value, then found!
We can return true, or a pointer to the node, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>If goal is &lt; current node's value, <em>go left</em></p></li>
<li><p>If goal is &gt; current node's value, <em>go right</em></p></li>
<li><p>If we hit a nullptr, the value was not found in the BST;
indicate that to the caller in some way</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What if there are duplicates? We'd have to keep traversing. 
Why would we have duplicates? Because we have two people with
the same name but they also have other data. </p>

<p>Carey bought all the prizes at Walmart and all the 
"inappropriate prizes" at Ahhz. The STL  is actually using
a BST.  and  also use BSTs. We're learning how
to do this stuff from scratch. </p>

<p>Recursively: </p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Data&gt;
class Node
{
    Data m_value;
    Node* m_left;
    Node* m_right;
};
</code></pre>

<p>These would be part of a larger BST class. </p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Data&gt;
bool searchBST(Data value, Node* ptr)
{  
    // Not found
    if (ptr == nullptr) 
        return false;  

    // Found!
    else if (value == ptr-&gt;m_value)
        return true; 

    // Value is less than current
    // Go left
    else if (value &lt; ptr-&gt;m_value)
        return(Search(value, ptr-&gt;left));

    // Don't forget to return the result
    // of a recursive call!

    // Value is greater than current
    // Go right
    else  
        return(Search(value, ptr-&gt;right));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Iteratively: </p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Data&gt;
bool searchBST(Data value, Node* ptr)
{  
    while (ptr != nullptr)
    {

        // Found!

            return true; 

        // Value is less than current
        // Go left
        else if (value &lt; ptr-&gt;m_value)
            ptr = ptr-&gt;m_left;

        // Value is greater than current

            ptr = ptr-&gt;m_right;
    }

    // Not found
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>// I just earned some Oreos and a prize ticket
// for answering that the average Big-O
// for an average BST is O(log2(N))</p>

<p>// It is NOT (Nlog2(N)); after all,
// we can traverse in O(N); why the hell
// would searching a binary <em>search</em> tree
// take longer? </p>

<p>In the average case, searching a BST will take 
<strong>O(log2(N))</strong> time, as we eliminate 50% of the possibilities
each time we go left or right. In the worst case (where
no branching off is possible), searching will take <strong>O(N)</strong> time. </p>

<p>The latter comes when we have a badly-formatted BST. </p>

<p>Insertion is trickier? Why? Because we have to maintain
the tree's very specific structure. The new value must be placed
such that the tree is still a BST afterward. </p>

<p>// Calling our search() function as our first step would be lame
// That's adding extra, unnecessary steps. Just have insert()
// be its own thang</p>

<p>General algo: </p>

<pre><code>IF the tree is empty
{
    Allocate a new node with given value
    Point root pointer to new node
    RETURN
}

Begin at root of tree

// Stopping condition checked iteratively or recursively
WHILE we're not done 
{
    // Value already exists; duplicates not allowed with this one
    IF given value is == current node's value
        RETURN 

    IF given value is &lt; current node's value
    {
        IF there is a left child
            Go left
        ELSE
            Allocate a new node with given value
            Set current node's left pointer to new node
            RETURN
    }

    IF given value is &gt; current node's value
    {
        IF there is a right child
            Go right
        ELSE
            Allocate a new node with given value
            Set current node's right pointer to new node
            RETURN
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>QUESTION: What if a new node belongs somewhere in-between
the root node and its descendants? </p>

<p>ANSWER: It would end up as a right child node of the intermediate. </p>

<p>As for Big-O? Well, we find the right insertion spot in
O(log2(N)) time (or worst case, O(N) time), and then insertion
is done in constant time. </p>

<p>Note how classic binary search trees just add stuff 
in whatever order it happens to arrive. </p>

<p>And deletion? Deletion is a huge pain with BSTs...</p>

<p>QUESTION: What if we had to delete the root node?! </p>

<p>// Carey is eating dinner with his TAs tonight
// He'll probably grill them intensely, haha</p>

<p>Given a random array of numbers, if you insert
them into a BST, the resulting tree will be rather
bushy, and its depth will be around log2(N). </p>

<p>But if we insert an ordered array of numbers, 
the BST will be a long line of nodes,
a really inefficient structure for a BST. </p>

<p>If our values are largely ordered, 
consider inserting them radiating outward
from the median, randomly, etc. That will 
lead to a much more balanced BST. </p>

<p>So why do we assume log2(N) for BSTs? Most
are gonna meet that. </p>

<p>Iteratively:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Data&gt;

<p>This can be done in O(log2(N)) time.

<p>This is simple: </p>

<p>Use the in-order traversal pattern, as this will go
down the left, then the current nodes, then the right, 
which aligns perfectly with alphabetical order. </p>

<p>This will be done in O(N) time, as we need to visit
all of the items. </p>

<p>This works for printing stuff out in numerical order too!</p>

<p>This is because in-order goes <em>in-order</em>:

<p>Even the oldest of trees must die eventually. </p>

<p>But how do we do so? Every node will have to be
destructed because it was likely manually allocated.</p>

<p>Easy: use the post-order traversal pattern. The youngest
die first. </p>

<pre><code>void razeBST(Node* doomed)

<p>STORY TIME: </p>

<p>The guy who pulled that joke on Carey (with all the 
scans running). </p>

<p>Carey was once an intern and had been working on something 
for a month. He booted up his computer one day: "No hard drive found." </p>

<p>He was thinking about he should have used version control. 
He opens the chassis, and found that his hard drive had been
disconnected. It was a prank. </p>

<p>He built a password sniffer, got his password, stored it
and said it whenever he walked by Sammie.</p>

<p>Sammie was in charge of the compilation and build process. </p>

<p>He came back from a night of partying. Carey wrote a program 
that would tweak all the assembly code to have syntax hours. 
It was only on his computer. It produced thousands and thousands
of errors when Sammie tried to run the build. Carey notes 
that he would be fired for such pranks these days. Symantec
was like a start-up in those days. </p>

<p>Carey: "Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness." </p>

<hr>

<p>To delete something from a BST, we need something to take
the place of the deleted node. How do we handle the re-linking? </p>

<p>If we don't handle the deletion properly, we'll break
the unique structure that characterizes a BST. </p>

<p>High-level algo: </p>

<p>Given a value V to delete:</p>

<pre><code>Find the value V in the tree with a standard BST search
{
    Use two pointers: a cur pointer and a parent pointer    

    If the node was found, delete it from the tree, preserving
    the structure
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Search for the value V: </p>

<p>Find the parent node of the doomed node</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deletion has 3 cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Node is a leaf node (this is easy)</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete the node, set the parent's child pointer to a nullptr</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our doomed node has only one child</p>

<ul>
<li>The grandchild jumps up to take the part of the child</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Our doomed node has two children </p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Case 1: </p>

<pre><code>// Determine if it's the left or right
// child that is doomed    
if (parent-&gt;left == cur)
    parent-&gt;left = nullptr;
else if (parent-&gt;right == cur)
    parent-&gt;right = nullptr;

// Delete the node
delete cur; 
</code></pre>

<p>Special case: What if it's the root node that is doomed? </p>

<p>The parent pointer is nullptr</p>

<p>If the root node is a leaf (there's only one node in the BST), 
delete the current node (the root node) and set the root
pointer to nullptr.</p>

<p>Case 2: </p>

<pre><code>// Get a pointer to cur's only child
Node* grandchild; 

// Since this is case 2, we know that
// there is only one child node

if (cur-&gt;left != nullptr)
    grandchild = cur-&gt;left; 
else
    grandchild = cur-&gt;right; 

// Link parent to grandchild
// This left/right check maintains
// the BST structure

if (parent-&gt;left == cur)
    parent-&gt;left = grandchild;

else if (parent-&gt;right == cur)
    parent-&gt;right = grandchild; 

delete cur; 
</code></pre>

<p>If the doomed node is the root node (with a single child): </p>

<pre><code>// Get a pointer to cur's only child
Node* grandchild; 

// Since this is case 2, we know that
// there is only one child node

if (cur-&gt;left != nullptr)
    grandchild = cur-&gt;left; 
else
    grandchild = cur-&gt;right; 

rootPtr = grandchild;

delete cur; // Where cur == original root node
</code></pre>

<p>Case 3: </p>

<p>We need to select a replacement that will 
still leave the BST consistent (and we can't add anything). 
It's a sort of puzzle.</p>

<p>In general, when deleting a node K, we want to replace K
with either </p>

<ol>
<li><p>K's left subtree's largest-valued child</p></li>
<li><p>K's right subtree's smallest-valued child.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This works out to preserve the structure. Either one
works.</p>

<p>It is actually two deletions, because we moving 
means we have to delete the moved node too. </p>

<p>Goal: Replace target node with a name that is
<code>&gt;</code> all names in left sub-tree or <code>&lt;</code> all names in right sub-tree</p>

<pre><code>ptr = cur-&gt; left
while (ptr-&gt;right != nullptr)
    ptr = ptr-&gt;right; 

Copy ptr's node's value into temp
Remove the node pointed to by ptr (the replacement) from the tree
    This is a recursive call, either case 1 or 2
    (as it's the rightmost or leftmost node;
    here it's the leftmost node)
Copy temp into cur
</code></pre>

<p>Case 3 deletion requires Case 1 or Case 2 deletion as well! </p>

<p>Then, the deletion will have been completed.</p>

<p>This WILL be on our final exam. Deletions in general will 
cause a classic BST to become more and more unbalanced. </p>

<p>No one uses classic BSTs these days; they just can't maintain
their efficiency. So instead, we'll use a balanced binary search
tree, which is what used in STL's ,  and . </p>

<p>Note that  and  are balanced search trees. </p>

<p>To print stuff out, it simply uses an in-order traversal
to print the items out in order. </p>

<p>// He's actuallly using the projector in this room today, 
// which is cool</p>

<p>// Jeffrey figured out another algorithm for BST node deletion 
// It heavily increases the depth of the tree though, 
// which decreases the efficiency of all of its operations</p>

<p>The old way of writing function pointers:</p>

<pre><code>insertion_sort(parameter, bool (*comp(...));
</code></pre>

<p>Smallberg wrote it </p>

<pre><code>insertion_sort(parameter, bool comp(...));
</code></pre>

<p>This lets us pass functions to functions. </p>

<p>This allows non-member functions to call upon other functions. </p>

<p>This lets us be more flexible with a function; we can
just change what sub-algo we pass into an algo, and instantly switch
out what it does. Note that the pointer function that we pass into 
had better have the same signature (return-type and parameters)
as we list in the function parameter. </p>

<p>e.g. :</p>

<pre><code>function(int parameter, string parameter, int sub_algo(char parameter1));
</code></pre>

<p>Then the sub_algo() looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>int sub_algo(char parameter1);
</code></pre>

<p>And the function call looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function(5, "test", sub_algo('k'));
</code></pre>

<p>QUESTION: Can we templatize function pointers? </p>

<p>Duplicates: If it was a single item, then we could just maintain
counters at each node for duplicates. Most BSTs have more data
associated with each node though. </p>

<hr>

<p>Challenge problem: Found an O(N) way to sort an array of 
1 million random numbers whose values range from 1 to 5. </p>

<p>We could just go through and count the numbers of 1's, 2's, etc.,
then go back through the array and stick that many 1's, 2's, etc. in. </p>

<p>This is done in k * N time, where k is a constant (the range 
span, here 1-5). This beats O(nlog2(n)), the best time complexity 
we know of for data-sets where we don't know much about their contents.</p>

<p>With something like the 1 million 1's, 2's, 3's, etc., though,
we know a set of very specific contraints on the data, and can figure
a clever O(n) way to sort them. O(n) should be the lower bound 
to sort the data, as we have to look at all the data. Unless we have
something where data knows about other data and its order, 
O(n) should be the lower bound for sorting. </p>

<p>!nullptr == true</p>

<p>dynamic_cast: the cast will work if the intended result is 
the same thing or something derived from it. </p>

<p>"Are all [blah] are [blah]?" We cannot go up the hierarchy,

attempted dynamic_cast in that direction would not work. </p>

<a id="user-content-huffman-encoding" class="anchor" href="#huffman-encoding" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Huffman Encoding</h3>

<p>Huffman encoding is one data compression technique used
for compressing/decompressing files, the sort of thing
we use to create ZIP archives and what-not. </p>

<p>First, a review of ASCII. </p>

<p>ASCII is the encoding scheme used by most modern computers. 
In this schema, each character is stored in memory as a
number, e.g. 'A' is 65. </p>

<p>This abstraction is merely a nice cover for how everything
is actually stored and handled as binary bits instead. </p>

<p>Huffman encoding works off the fact that many things repeat
sequences of bits. Also, note that this is a <em>lossless</em> compression
method.</p>

<p>Its general algo: </p>

<ol>
<li>Compute the frequency of each character</li>
<li>Build a Huffman tree (a binary tree) based on these frequencies</li>
<li>Use this binary tree to convert the original file's contents 
to a more compressed form</li>
<li>Save the converted (compressed) data to a file</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-count-frequency" class="anchor" href="#count-frequency" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Count Frequency</h4>

<p>The first step is really like computing a histogram, 
a chart that records how frequently something shows up. </p>

<p>These are common in early elementary:</p>

<pre><code>// The frequency with which the 
// digits 1, 2 &amp; 3 appear in some larger number,
// as one arbitrary example 

        x
x       x
x   x   x
x   x   x

1   2   3
</code></pre>

<p>For Huffman encoding, we'll probably have something like:</p>

<pre><code>CHARACTER      FREQUENCY
---------      ---------

   'U'             5
   'C'             9
   'L'             2
   'A'             4
   '!'             3
</code></pre>

<h4>

<p>To build a Huffman tree based on those frequencies:</p>

<p>NOTE: A Huffman tree is a <em>binary tree</em>, NOT a BST. </p>

<pre><code>Create a binary tree leaf node for each entry
in the frequency count table, but do NOT
insert any into a tree (yet)

While we have more than one node left: 

    Find the two nodes with lowest frequencies

    Create a new parent node

    Link the parent to each of the children

    Set the parent's total frequency equal to
    the sum of its children's frequencies

    Place the new parent node in our grouping

Now label each left edege with a 0
each right edge with a 1
</code></pre>

<p>The bit encoding for a character is the path of
0's and 1's taken from the root for three to the character
of interest. </p>

<p>Multiple trees are possible (depending on how we
grouped nodes together, as there can be ties), so multiple encoding
schemes are possible. Note how it uses <em>fewer</em> bits for more common
characters. In addition, the encodings have <em>unique prefixes</em>. 
It is unambiguous in this encoding as to what encoding lines up
to what character. This can be done with groups of characters too. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-compression" class="anchor" href="#compression" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compression</h4>

<p>Now use the binary tree to convert the original file's contents
into a more compressed form, i.e. find the sequence of bits
(1's and 0's) for each char in the message. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-save-the-archive" class="anchor" href="#save-the-archive" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Save the Archive</h4>

<p>Now take this compressed sequence and save it to a file,
one that will be much smaller than the original file. </p>

<p>Of course, we need to attach the encoding scheme used,
or else we won't know what each sequence of bits was
supposed to represent. We need to encode the tree in
a way: each tree was unique, so it's added <em>overhead</em>. </p>

<p>For small enough stuff, that overhead would push
the "compressed" file over the size of the original,
for larger files, we can save 40-80% of disk space! </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-decoding" class="anchor" href="#decoding" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Decoding</h4>

<p>To decode, we: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Extract the encoding scheme from the compressed file</p></li>
<li><p>Build a Huffman tree (a binary tree based on the encodings)
Follow the 0's and 1's, as they indicate left/right, and
insert a new node there.</p></li>
<li><p>Use this binary tree to convert the compressed file's contents
back to the original characters
Go until we hit a leaf, then output the character located there.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the converted (uncompressed) data to a file</p></li>
</ol>

<p>ZIP files use an even more effective compression. </p>

<p>The best we can do here is compress from 1 byte to a bit. 
If we compress larger characters, we can save even more space. </p>

<p>To search: O(log2(N))</p>

<p>To erase: O(log2(N))</p>

<p>Traversal: O(N)</p>

<p>BBSTs are <em>O(log2(N))</em> for everything except
for traversal. Note how they don't have the worst-case
O(N) possibility, unlike a normal BST. </p>

<hr>

<p>We've noticed that BSTs become less efficient over time
as we insert and delete nodes. Often, this is because
they linearize out and deepen in their depth. Ideally,
we want to make as few visits to nodes as possible to get
to stuff and get stuff done. We don't want a pathological 
trail that takes forever to traverse. We want a bushy Christmas tree. </p>

<p>We want to maintain an <em>even tree</em>.</p>

<p>Definition: A binary tree is <em>perfectly balanced</em> if
for each node, the number of nodes in its <em>left and right subtrees</em>
<em>differ by at most one</em>.</p>

<p>Three popular approaches exist for building a BBST:</p>

<ul>
<li>AVL trees</li>
<li>2-3 trees</li>
<li>Red-black trees</li>
</ul>

<p>We're doing AVL; look up the others sometime. There are many others
too. They shift nodes around as needed to balance the tree.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-avl-trees" class="anchor" href="#avl-trees" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AVL Trees</h4>

<p>AVL Trees are BSTs in which the height of the left and right
sub-trees of <em>each node</em> differ by <em>at most 1</em>.</p>

<p>Note the difference in balancing requirements. </p>

<p>They are implemented by assigning each node a 
<em>balance value</em>:</p>

<p>0: the node's right and left-subtrees have the same height
-1: the node's left subtree is 1 higher than the right
1: the node's right subtree is 1 higher than the left</p>

<h5>
<a id="user-content-insertion-1" class="anchor" href="#insertion-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Insertion</h5>

<p>Case 1:</p>

<p>After we insert a new node into the AVL tree,
<em>all</em> nodes in the tree still have balances of -1, 0, or 1.</p>

<p>In this case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert the new node normally (just like in a vanilla BST)</li>
<li>Update the balances of all the parent nodes, from
the new leaf to the root</li>
<li>If all of the balances are still 0, -1, or 1, done!</li>
</ol>

<p>Case 2: We insert a new node, and it causes one or more
balances to become less than -1 or greater than 1</p>

<p>This requires us to <em>rebalance</em> the tree to the range
of acceptable balances. </p>

<p>There are two-subcases: single &amp; double rotation</p>

<p>In <em>single rotation</em>, some nodes are rotated over once. 
In <em>double rotation</em>, two rebalances are required. </p>

<p>There are at most two shifts in an AVL tree. </p>

<p>Note that the STL  and  classes use
BBSTs (though not necessarily AVL trees). </p>

<p>Know that rebalancing (even twice) is <em>O(log2(N))</em>, so 
insertion is still <em>O(log2(N))</em>.</p>

of a division: </p>

<p>E.g. N % 5:</p>

<p>0 % 5 = 0
1 % 5 = 1 (5 doesn't go into 1 at all)
2 % 5 = 2
3 % 5 = 3
4 % 5 = 4
5 % 5 = 0 (clean division)
6 % 5 = 1
7 % 5 = 2
8 % 5 = 3
9 % 5 = 4
10 % 5 = 0
...</p>

<p>Note that modulo of a number returns a range of numbers
guaranteed to be between 0 and that number N - 1, 
so <em>(variable % N) ranges from 0 - (N - 1)</em></p>

<p>To get a specific range: </p>

<a id="user-content-hash-tables" class="anchor" href="#hash-tables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hash Tables</h3>

<p>Thus far, the most efficient ADT we know
of thus far is a balanced binary search tree,
O(log2(N)), for everything.</p>

<p>Can we do better? How about the audacious goal
of attaining <em>O(1)</em>? </p>

<p>Let's begin with a pseudo-predecessor to a true
hash table:</p>

<p>What if we wanted to create an ADT that could
store all the UCLA Student IDs (9 digits),
where the indices are the ID numbers. That
would a 1 billion element array!</p>

<p>To add a new ID#: set array[N] = true</p>

<p>We now know that that ID is active
when we go straight to it. Accessing
an element in an array is done in constant-time. </p>

<p>This is insanely fast--but insanely expensive
in terms of memory. We only have ~50,000 students,
but have 1 billion element array. We're wasting
999,950,000 slots just to know if a student ID
is active or not. </p>

<p>So let's reduce the number of slots required.</p>

<p>NachenSmall Corp. dictates that our program must
use 100,000 slots. </p>

<p>We need a mathmatical function that can take in
an ID# and somehow converts it to a unique
slot number between 0 and 99,999 in the new, smaller
array. </p>

<p>Our domain is [0, 1 billion - 1] and the range
is [0, 99,999] for our function.</p>

<p>f(x): [0, 1 billion - 1] -&gt; [0, 99,999]</p>

<p>This will be our <em>hash function</em> for converting between
the original and something smaller and more compact. </p>

<p>To add a new item: </p>

<pre><code>void addItem(int n)
{
    int slot = hashFunc(n);
    m_array[slot] = true; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or: <code>m_array[hashFunc(n)] = true;</code></p>

<p>Slots in hash tables are called <em>buckets</em>. </p>

<pre><code>int hashFunc(int idNum)
{
    int bucket = idNum % ARRAY_SIZE;
    return bucket;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function will return values between 
0 and 99,999, perfect for our new, smaller array. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-hash-collisions" class="anchor" href="#hash-collisions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hash Collisions</h3>

<p>Note how we may end up with the same hashes.
This is known as a <strong>collision</strong>, and this is a problem.</p>

<p>For us, this happens when the last five digits
of the ID number are the same.</p>

<p>We have <em>ambiguity</em>: which ID number are we trying
to represent? </p>

<p>A collision is where two or more values both 
"hash" to the same bucket. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-closed-hash-table-with-linear-probing" class="anchor" href="#closed-hash-table-with-linear-probing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Closed Hash Table with Linear Probing</h3>

<p>To deal with collisions, this is one possibility. </p>

<p>We figure out a target bucket via that hash function.</p>

<p>If the target buck is empty, we store our value there,
but we store the <em>full original value</em>, not the hash.</p>

<p>This prevents ambiguity. If the bucket is occupied,
we scan down until we find the first
empty bucket. Put the value there. </p>

<p>Here, insertion and searching is O(N) in the worst case,
where the table is almost filled-up, and there are
many collisions. </p>

<p>To create a hash table, we 
<em>must consider the size of our intended dataset</em>.</p>

<p>To search, we compute our bucket number with our
hash function, and we <em>probe linearly</em> downward
until we find our value or hit an <em>empty bucket</em>;
the latter case means that the <em>value is not in the hash table</em>.
This will wrap around (thanks to modulo)
to try to insert in the earlier buckets too, if possible.</p>

<p>In general, this approach addresses collision
by putting each value <em>as close as possible</em>
to its intended bucket. We have <em>locality</em>. </p>

<p>And, since we store the original value, there
is no ambiguity. </p>

<p>The hash table is called "closed" because it has
a <em>fixed-size</em>. Example: a night-club has a limited
capacity. Once we run out of empty buckets, we cannot
add new values. We'd have to create a new hash table
and copy over the old values by re-hashing (to accommodate
the new size of the larger hash table). </p>

<p>In code: </p>

<pre><code>struct Bucket
{
    int idNum; // The value we store
    bool used; // Is the bucket empty? 
               // Initialize this to TRUE
}; 
</code></pre>

<p>We could also choose to terminate search
or insertion operations after a certain number of 
tries if we know that our hash table couldn't be that bad.</p>

<p>What about searching and collisions? We stored the
full, original value! We search linearly, 
and in the worst case, check all N buckets to see if
our value is present, wrapping around to the beginning
as needed. </p>

<p>Note that recursion is pretty much never used with 
hash tables. Do it iteratively. </p>

<p>The cool thing about hash tables? We can store 
whatever the hell we want in them. We could have
a comprehensive database, which we can search 
by a particular field, the one that was hashed
to buckets.</p>

<p>We search by the hashed field, and can then grab
the other fields' data. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-deletion-1" class="anchor" href="#deletion-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deletion</h4>

<p>What happens if we just zero-out a particular position? </p>

<p>Our search algorithm will stop prematurely (when we're
looking for a value that has collided with another and
and have put the collisions in later buckets) because
we hit an empty bucket. </p>

<p>The moral: <em>Use closed hash tables where we</em>
<em>never need to delete anything</em>. We are limited
by the fact that we need to account for the hashing.
We'd end up with all sorts of special cases and 
extra complexity. </p>

<p>Examples: dictionary, a list of the dead (no zombies!)</p>

<p>If we delete where a collision, we may prematurely 
abort a search, failing to find the sought-for value. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-open-hash-table" class="anchor" href="#open-hash-table" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Hash Table</h3>

<p>Now let's see another way to deal with collisions,
one that avoids a closed hash table's problems
with deletion and size capping. </p>

<p>Now, our buckets will point to a linked list
of values. </p>

<p>To insert: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compute a bucket number with our hash function</p></li>
<li><p>Add the new value to the linked list at array[bucket]</p></li>
<li><p>Done!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, it's constant time to get to a bucket, 
but to traverse the linked list, it's O(L). </p>

<p>There is no a priori size limit to the open hash table. 
It'll slow down with too many items and collisions though. </p>

<p>To search: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compute bucket # with hash function</p></li>
<li><p>Search the linked list at array[bucket]</p></li>
<li><p>If we hit the end of the linked list,
the item is not in our table!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To delete: </p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the right bucket using the hash function</li>
<li>Remove the node from the linked list </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that closed hash tables are faster for when
we know our maximum size, and we avoid the dynamic
allocation, deallocation of open hash tables. </p>

<p><strong>If we need to delete, we must use a open hash table.</strong></p>

<p>If we size the hash table large enough, then we avoid 
multiple collisions, and our average Big-O will 
be ~O(1) in practice. O(1) on our test. </p>

<p>In the worst-case (everything is a collision), then
it's O(N). </p>

<p>We could of course store the items in a BST or BBST instead
for even faster operation. That adds complexity though.</p>

<p>Or: a hash table within a hash table!</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-hash-table-efficiency" class="anchor" href="#hash-table-efficiency" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hash Table Efficiency</h3>

<p>Efficiency depends on </p>

<p>A. Type of hash table
B. How full the hash table is
C. How many collisions are in the hash table</p>

<p>If we have a completely or nearly empty hash table: 
O(1) for everything. (Go to right bucket, insert/search)</p>

<p>We avoid linear probing (closed) or linear traversal (open). </p>

<p>BUT, if our hash table is nearly full: 
it may now be O(N) for insertion and searching. </p>

<p>So our trade-off is between hash table size and efficiency. </p>

<p>The <strong>load</strong> of a hash table is the max number of intended values
divided by the number of buckets to be available. </p>

<p>This is almost always &lt; 1.</p>

<p><strong>L = max/buckets</strong>. </p>

<p>Example: 0.1 = our hash table has 10 more buckets than needed
(we avoid collisions)</p>

<p>To compute the <em>average number of tries</em> needed to insert/find
an item for a <em>closed table with linear probing</em>: </p>

<pre><code>1/2(1 + 1/(1 - L)) for L &lt; 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>For an <em>open hash table</em>:</p>

<pre><code>1 + L/2 for L &lt; 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>There's not too big a difference between the two (they'll be around
~O(1)). </p>

<p>We would obviously try to avoid loading up the hash table
too heavily. </p>

<p>Remember: dynamic size with deletion too? Open hash table. </p>

<p>Review of hash tables load factor. Note that hash
tables are best for when we know how many items
we'll need to handle, max. If we do not know, then 
some other data structure would do better. </p>

<p>Why would we use a closed hash table rather than an
open hash table? Because allocation is slow in comparison 
to the fast, constant-time insertion into a closed hash table. </p>

<p>Also, hash tables are terrible for traversing something in 
order, e.g. the names we manage in our Database for Project 4. </p>

<p>For searching, however, the totally beat everything.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-sizing-a-hashtable" class="anchor" href="#sizing-a-hashtable" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sizing a Hashtable</h3>

<p>To size a hashtable appropriately: </p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the max number of items</li>
<li>Determine the average number of searches we want
to find an item in this hash table type (closed or open)</li>
<li>Solve for the load factor</li>
<li>Load factor is max/buckets; solve for number of buckets</li>
</ol>

<p>We're working backward to get the number of buckets. </p>

<p>We're looking for an effective trade-off between 
memory usage and fast searches. It all depends on our
constraints. </p>

<p>Always try to choose a <em>prime</em> number of items.
This allows for a more even distribution and fewer collisions.
It'll divide evenly into fewer numbers. </p>

<p>Example: 2,021 instead of 2,000</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-hashing-non-numbers" class="anchor" href="#hashing-non-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hashing Non-Numbers</h3>

<p>What if we want to hash a string? </p>

<p>We need a hash() function that will give us numbers. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>int hash(string&amp; name)
{
    string name; 

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; name.length(); i++)
        total = total + name[i];

    total = total % HASH_TABLE_SIZE;

    return total;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this just adds up the encoding values for 
the letters, and so this produces the same result
for different strings, e.g. BAT and TAB. </p>

<p>Those are different strings, and we should get
different hashes for them, but this hash function doesn't
do that, so this means we will have a lot of collisions.</p>

<p>Alternatives:</p>

<pre><code>total = total + (i+1) * name[i];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this could cause overflow problems
where the string.size() * blah &gt; INT_MAX.</p>

<p>There will always be collisions, no matter what our 
hashing scheme is. Hash tables just have to deal with 
that reality. This one does eliminate the problem with
anagrams hashing to the same value though.</p>

<ol>
<li>A hash function must <em>always</em> give the same bucket number
for a given input value. </li>
</ol>

<p>We do NOT want random hashes!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The hash function should disperse items throughout the 
hash array as randomly as possible. </p></li>
<li><p>When coming up with a new hash function, always
measure how well it disperses items (do experiments). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Create a graph of the number of items per bucket number. </p>

<pre><code>x
x x x x x
1 2 3 4 5 
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<p>Try CRC32, CRC64, SHA2, etc., but MD5, etc. are not secure
enough cryptographically. These are open-source hashing functions.</p>

<p>Note that we still have add our own modulo based on our table
size. </p>

<p>Speed: O(1) vs. O(log2(N))</p>

<p>Simplicity: Simple vs. complex</p>

<p>Max size: Limited (closed HT), 
          or high load impedes performance</p>

<p>vs. the consistency of BSTs under high load,
especially if balanced.</p>

<p>If we want to exapnd a hash table, it's 
like creating a whole new hash table,
though there are incremental expansion schemes. </p>

<p>Space efficiency: HTs can waste space; BSTs use
only as much space as needed</p>

<p>Ordering: HTs are random; BSTs are inherently ordered</p>

<p>Just searching: HT
Traversing or order required in some way: BST</p>

<p>What is the cost of sorting items? Nlog2(N),
even with our fastest sorting algorithms.</p>

<p>To get items in order with a HT, we'd have to sort
fast. </p>

<p>What if we're mostly searching rather than doing 
stuff in order? This favors using a hash table. 
Conversely, if order is of greater importance, use 
a BST. It all depends on the <em>use case</em>. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-tables" class="anchor" href="#tables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tables</h3>

<p>Say we want to keep tracks of all our friends
and info on them. </p>

<p>A group of related data is called a <strong>record</strong> 
or a <strong>row of data</strong>. </p>

<p>Each record has a number of <strong>fields</strong> like name, 
age, etc. </p>

<p>A collection of records is called a <em>table</em>. </p>

<p>We may have many records that share some fields, 
but a field with a unique value for every record
is called a <em>key field</em>. </p>

<p>Have a struct/class represent a record, then have a
collection of them be our table (e.g. vector, array, etc.)</p>

<p>// 10,000 lines! </p>

<p>In our Project, we don't happen to have a key field. </p>

<p>A <strong>table</strong> is an ADT onto itself. It is designed 
to hold records conforming to a particular <strong>schema</strong>
that specifies the format of records and their fields.</p>

<p>To search a table by a particular field, we could
do simple linear search, but this is O(N). </p>

<p>Instead, we could sort and do a binary search. 
That'd be O(log2(N)). This is a problem for insertion,
of course, as we have to re-sort every time we insert. 
That's an overheard of a O(Nlog2(N)).</p>

<p>This would also lock in our searching abilities. 
If everything is ordered by name, how would we search by 
name or phone number? Searching by one field would be
O(log2(N)), but everything else would be linear, O(N). </p>

<p>What about storing our records in a binary search tree? 
This avoids re-sorting, but we still are limited to efficient
search by one particular field. </p>

<p>We could create separate BSTs, one organized by one field,
one organized by another field, but this is duplicating
data, wasting space. </p>

<p>Intead, we'll still use a vector to store all our records.</p>

<p>Then, we'll have a secondary data structure that associates
a field with their slot number in the vector. </p>

<p>This secondary structure lets quickly look up a name, and
find out where that person and all the associated data are in the 
records structure. BST-based Maps or MultiMaps are perfect
for associating indexed fields to their slot numbers.</p>

<p>These secondary data structures are called <strong>indices</strong>
(sing. <strong>index</strong>), which use B-Trees and let us know where
data is stored. </p>

<p>However, note that we are still duplicating some data, 
the indexed fields. </p>

<p>Once we know the slot number, a -like structure
is perfect for constant-time access to the particular
item. </p>

<p>Why do we use slot numbers and not pointers to items? 
We can't fit everything in memory (databases are typically
massive). </p>

<p>What happens if we have to delete a record? 
Updating all the indices and such would be a pain.
Instead, we could put a <em>tombstone</em> marker in the place of
deleted item, to let us know that the record is available.</p>

<p>There was a computer program called Wisdom,
that would randomly generate paragraphs, footnotes,

paper. So Carey generated the conclusion to his physics
paper using this. Recently, some guys have generated
random research papers and showing how this nonsense 
was getting accepted at conferences. This illustrates
the lameness of academia. </p>

<p>We have as many indexes as we need for our
particular table. </p>

<p>Note that a  can use the brackets [] operator.  </p>

<p>To insert: </p>

<p>Add the record to the records data structure. 
Update the index data structures as needed
for each of our indexed fields. </p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-hash-based-indices" class="anchor" href="#hash-based-indices" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hash-Based Indices</h4>

<p>Of course, we could use hash tables
to search fields and associated hash numbers. </p>

<p>Modern databases use either one, depending on whether
order matters. </p>

<p>Understand how our table will be used, which will
let us decide how to index each field. If we do
later need to output stuff in order, we can
always just run a sort. </p>

There's a hash-based  as well, a "hash-set". </p>

<p>We can use this for our project!</p>

<p>This is inserting items into a hash table, but each
item has data associated with it (or two data, as with
an ). This allows constant-time operations
with everything. Again, decide if we need to output stuff
in order. </p>

<p>These will resize automatically and they allow deletion
as well, suggesting they use a open hash table. </p>

<p>They're "unordered" because HTs are unordered.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-priority-queue" class="anchor" href="#priority-queue" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Priority Queue</h3>

<p>In a regular queue, FIFO, first-come, first-served. </p>

<p>Instead, each item in a PQ has a <strong>priority rating</strong>.
We always dequeue the item with the highest rating. </p>

<p>They support a new item, get the value if the highest
priority item, remove the highest priority item. </p>

<p>We need to sepcify how to determine the priority
of each item in the queue. e.g. Doctor determining
which injured person to treat first. </p>

<p>We could do this with a BBST, but what if we a had a
limited set of priorities (high, medium, low)? </p>

<p>What's a basic data structure to handle this? </p>

<p>Three linked lists: one for each priority rating.
Think of seating classes for First Class, Business, Coach
for airplanes. </p>

<p>But what if we have a large number of priorities? </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-heaps" class="anchor" href="#heaps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Heaps</h3>

<p>This is not the heap, as in the memory location. </p>

<p>Instead, a <strong>heap</strong> uses a <strong>complete binary tree</strong>,
useful for priority queues, in which (assuming N depth):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The top N - 1 levels of the tree are completely
filled with nodes. </p></li>
<li><p>The bottom-most node are as far left as possible, 
with no empty slots between nodes</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are NOT BSTs! </p>

<p>There are two types of heaps: <strong>minheaps</strong>
and <strong>maxheaps</strong>. </p>

<p>Maxheap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quickly insert a new item (Olog2(N))</li>
<li>Quickly retrieve the largest item from the heap</li>
</ol>

<p>Minheap: </p>

<ol>
<li>Quickly insert a new item</li>
<li>Quickly retrieve the smallest item from the heap</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-maxheap" class="anchor" href="#maxheap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Maxheap</h4>

<p>Maxheap BT follows these rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>The value contained by a node is always &gt;= values of its children</li>
<li>The tree is a COMPLETE binary tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>Minheap would reverse the 1st rule to &lt;=.</p>

<p>This is not a BST, so only the immediate node family 
matters. </p>

<p>Note how the biggest value is <em>guaranteed</em> to be at
the top of the tree. </p>

<p>So peeking at the top value is O(1). </p>

<h5>

<ol>
<li><p>If the tree is empty, return ERROR</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, the top item in the tree is the biggest value
Remember it for later</p></li>
<li><p>If the heap has only one node, then delete it and
return the saved value</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, copy the value from the right-most 
node in the bottom-most row to the node</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the <em>right-most node in the bottom-most level</em>
(Choosing this node keeps things left-justified, to avoid creating gaps). </p></li>
<li>
<p>Repeatedly swap the just-moved value with the larger
of its two children until its value is greater than
or equal to both of its children (<strong>sifting down</strong>). </p>

<p>If it's already &gt;=, then we never move it. 
In the end, the second-biggest item from before
is now the biggest item, and has been moved to the top, 
maintaining the validity of the maxheap. This lets
us handle any number of priorities, where the maxheap
inserts based on priority rating. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Return the value from earlier to the caller</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will be on our final exam. Make it easy by drawing
diagrams. </p>

<a id="user-content-array-based-implementation" class="anchor" href="#array-based-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Array-Based Implementation</h5>

<p>We never actually use a BST with pointers 
for heaps. It's hard to locate the appropriate locations. </p>

<p>Instead, we'll use an array. </p>

<p><strong>We know that each level of our tree has 2x (twice)</strong>
<strong>the number of the nodes of the previous level.</strong></p>

<p>We can think of translating a complete binary tree (CBT)
over to an array, one level at a time.</p>

<p>If we just have our nodes, one level at a time, in
an array, we know where each level starts. This how
the memory heap works. What about sizing the heap?
Either know the size ahead of time, or use a 
or something else that can resize dyanmically. </p>

<p>We use a simple int variable to track how many items
are in our heap. What about finding the children and parent? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We can always find the root value in <code>heap[0]</code></p></li>
<li><p>The bottom-most, right-most node in <code>heap[count - 1]</code></p></li>
<li><p>We can always find the bottom-most, left-most 
empty spot (to add a new value) in <code>heap[count]</code></p></li>
<li><p>We can add/remove a node by simply setting
<code>heap[count] = value</code> and/or updating the count.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is better than a sorted array that we resort
at each insertion. That'd be be O(Nlog2(N)), vs. this,
which is O(log2(N)).</p>

<p>To locate a node's children:</p>

<p>(given the slot number of the parent)</p>

<p><strong>left child(parent) =  2 * parent + 1</strong>
<strong>right child(parant) = 2 * parent + 2</strong></p>

<p>2i + 1, 2i + 2 are the simple, easy formulas,
where i is the slot number of the parent</p>

<p>// This can be derived from manually listing
// the translations</p>

<p>To find the parent node:</p>

<p><strong>parentSlot(childSlot) = (childSlot - 1 ) / 2</strong></p>

<p>(i - 1) / 2 works because of integer division. </p>

<p>Reheapification is done immediately upon insertion,
which we do by comparing to the parent (which we find 
via these formulas). </p>

<p>Summary: </p>

<ul>
<li>Root node at heap[0]</li>
<li>Bottom-right at heap[count - 1]</li>
<li>Botom-left at heap[count]</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all we need to build a heap. </p>

<p>Recommendation: Use a tree, then copy over the values
from the tree back into the array, to make things
easier. </p>

<p>"This is not a heap. This is a heap helper. 
This is not a hamburger, this is a Hamburger Helper." </p>

<p>We need to comparing, and we need to check

<p>Since we need to compare and swap. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-heapsort" class="anchor" href="#heapsort" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Heapsort</h3>

<p>Heapsort is guaranteed to at least Nlog2(N)),
the naïve one that uses a separate heap.</p>

<p>The real heapsort doesn't use a separate array. 
That naïve implemenation had a lot of overhead. </p>

<p>Instead, we can do everything within the array. </p>

<p>This semi-official is not quite as efficient as the fully
official one, then we'll see the altter. </p>

<ol>
<li>Convert our input array into a maxheap (shuffle around)</li>
<li>While are numbers left in the array
A. Remove the biggest value from the heap
b. Place it in the last open slot of the array</li>
</ol>

<p>To cleverly shuffle around the values: </p>

<p>Start by visualizing our array as a tree. 
Note, this algo operates on the array itself. </p>

<pre><code>for (curNode = lastNode through rootNode) [rightmost, bottommost,
                                           last item in array]
{
    Focus on subtree at curNode

    Think of this subtree as a maxheap

    Keep shifting the top value down until your subtree
    becomes a valid maxheap [use heapification algo
    where we swap with the larger child until the current
    is larger than both of its children] 

    // Move to next Node
}
</code></pre>

<p>Start at the bottom, keep heapfiying from bottom to top.
Check that the maxheap tree is correct. </p>

<p>We've heapified higher and higher subtrees, relying on the 
lower subtrees.</p>

<p>Note that we wasted a lot of time looking at single-node subtrees. </p>

<p>We only need to re-heapify when we reached a subtree with at least
two nodes. To jump to that: </p>

<pre><code>startNode = N/2 - 1; // Lowest one down, right-most with 2 children

for (curNode = startNode thru rootNode)
</code></pre>

<p>Jump to that slot in the array, and corrolate with the tree nodes. </p>

<p>Note that at least half of a complete binary tree has no children,
because of the bottom row. With this, we skip 50% of the reheapification,
(N/2 items), so this lets us increase efficiency. </p>

<p>While there are numbers left in the heap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Extract the biggest value from the maxheap and re-heapify
This frees up the last slot in the array, and the heap now
occupies only the first N - 1 slots. </p></li>
<li><p>Put the extracted value into this freed-up slot of the array.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Next time, we'll extract, leaving the second-to-last slot free. </p>

<p>Decrement the count as part of the extraction; this is how we
know when we're done.</p>

<p>Minheap would give a descending order. </p>

<p>Extraction, reheapification, insertion -&gt; in order! </p>

<p>Converting an array into a maxheap is O(N) because of
how we skip 50% of the nodes. </p>

<p>"I found it on Wikipedia so it must be true." </p>

<p>Extraction and reheapifying is O(log2(N))</p>

<p>So O(N + Nlog2(N)) --&gt; <strong>O(Nlog2(N))</strong></p>

<a id="user-content-introduction-to-graphs" class="anchor" href="#introduction-to-graphs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction to Graphs</h3>

<p>A <strong>graph</strong> is an ADT that stores a set of <strong>entities</strong>
and keeps track of the <strong>relationships</strong> between all of them. </p>

<p>Examples: People and relationships, cities and distances.</p>

<p>It might not just be a connection, but a value associated with
that connections. The edge has a value.</p>

<p>Web pages and links between them (Google Page Rank). </p>

<p><strong>Vertices (nodes)</strong> are the people, city, web pages, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Edges (arcs)</strong> connect two vertices to each other. </p>

<p>Edges typically connect two vertices, but self-connections
are also possible, e.g. a bus on a looping route. </p>

<p>There are <strong>directed graphs</strong> where each edge goes from 
one vertex to another in a specific direction. It
goesn't go both ways, e.g. one-way flight.  A--&gt;B</p>

<p>THere are <strong>undirected graph</strong>, where all edges are <em>bi-directional</em>,
where we can go either away along each edge. A--B</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-adjacency-matrix" class="anchor" href="#adjacency-matrix" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjacency Matrix</h4>

<p>Use a double-dimensional array with the size of both dimensions
equal to the number of vertices. </p>

<p>Each element indicates whether or not there is an edge between
vertex i and vertex j. </p>

<p>e.g. bool graph [5][5]; graph[0][3] = true; </p>

<p>This would be a directed graph. Unless, [0][3] and [3][0] are
marked true. [0][0] would indicate a self-connection. </p>

<p>This could be changed to values, and even have different values
depending on which way we go. These are directed edges. </p>

<p>This is called an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong>. </p>

<p>A BST is a form of a directed graph: we can only 
go to the children, and is a directed acylic graph (DAG). </p>

<p>To represent an undirected graph, just bi-directionally connect:
[i][j] == [j][i]</p>

<p>An interesting property around them: </p>

<p>If we multiply the matrix by itself: All the people
are now identified as 2 connnections away from someone 
away. The first one marked those 1 away. Do it again,
and we get 3 away. </p>

<p>"Why does that work?" "I have no idea." </p>

<p>I'll double-check the matrix math after I take 33A. </p>

<p>Facebook and other social networks do not use this
technique; this would involve very large arrays.

<a id="user-content-adjacency-list" class="anchor" href="#adjacency-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjacency List</h3>

<p>We can use an array of linked lists or a 
vector of linked lists to represent a graph. </p>

<p>If we add a number j to list i, there is an edge
from vertex i to vertex j.</p>

<pre><code>// 0--&gt;3
graph[0].push_back(3); 
</code></pre>

<p>Each list lets us know the connections. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-list-vs-matrix" class="anchor" href="#list-vs-matrix" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>List vs. Matrix</h3>

<p>Scenario #1: 10 million users where most people
have a few hundred people. Instead of a 10x10 million
array, use an adjacency list instead. </p>

<p>This is called a <strong>sparse graph</strong>, where there are only
a few connections from one part to another part. </p>

<p>Scenario #2: 1,000 cities with airlines from city to 
almost every other city. Use an adjacency matrix. </p>

<p>Low node connectivity (many items) --&gt; use an adjacency list</p>

<p>High node connectivity (few items) --&gt; use an adjacency matrix</p>

<p>Consider the specific use case. It would be faster
to search an adjacency matrix. </p>

<p>We could have an array of hash tables or an array of sets, etc. </p>

<p>Use an adjacency matrix where there are lots of edges
between few vertices (<strong>dense graph</strong>). The number of cells
grows O(N^2). </p>

<p>Use an adjacency list for where there are few edges
and lots of vertices (&gt;10,000), e.g. Facebook. </p>

<p>Individual vertices are connected to few other vertices. </p>

<a id="user-content-graph-traversals" class="anchor" href="#graph-traversals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Graph Traversals</h3>

<p>A tree is a kind of graph. </p>

<p>Depth-first and breadth-first traversals. </p>

<p>Depth-first is like a pre-order traversal. Use recursion! </p>

<p>Breadth-first is like a level-order traversal. Use a queue! </p>

<p>Depth-first keeps moving till it hits a dead end or a 
previous-ly visited vertex, then it backtracks and tries
another path. (Check if previously-visited; no bread crumbs used)</p>

<p>Use a stack or recursion.</p>

<p>Breadth-first keeps exploring in growing concentric circles,
exploring all vertices 1 away, 2 away, etc. </p>

<p>This is like tree traversal and like our maze exploration. </p>
