title: Practical Online Security
---

Thank you to all who attended my workshop—"Practical Online Security"—this
week! Below is the promised handout of links to resources, both for topics
covered and not covered. This guide will be refined over time.

---

## Summary 

A great baseline level of security can be achieved by: 

1. Educating yourself on the dangers facing you
2. Keeping all of your software up-to-date (automatic is best) 
3. Using multi-factor authentication
4. Backing up everything! 
5. Using a password manager! 


## The Threats 

### Social Engineering

*Social engineering* is when someone tricks you into divulging 
information or performing an action that helps them do something
malicious. Victims often have no idea until problems occur.

Here are some examples of social engineering wreaking havoc:

* [I dared two expert hackers to destroy my life. Here’s what happened.](http://fusion.net/story/281543/real-future-episode-8-hack-attack/)

* [How Apple and Amazon Security Flaws Led to My Epic Hacking](http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/)

* [Amazon’s customer service backdoor](https://medium.com/@espringe/amazon-s-customer-service-backdoor-be375b3428c4#.1e6wa28jc)

* [Namecheap live chat social engineering leads to loss of 2 VPS](http://www.postphp.com/namecheap-livechat-social-engineering-leads-to-loss-of-2-vps/)

* [What happens when a top privacy and security regulator falls for an email scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/22/what-happens-when-a-top-privacy-and-security-regulator-falls-for-an-email-scam/)


### Malware 

*Malware* is [malicious software](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/what-are-malware-viruses-spyware-and-cookies-and-what-differentiates-them), programs that perform actions like: stealing passwords, siphoning funds
from your bank account, and so on.

Windows users need no reminders of its omnipresence.

It affects Macs too; here are news stories on two recent examples:

* [MacDefender](http://www.macworld.com/article/1160098/macdefender.html)
* [Flashback](http://www.macworld.com/article/1166254/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_flashback_trojan.html)


#### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Consult a professional if you face the threat of nation-state level
malware like these: 

* [Stuxnet](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/)
* [Equation Group](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/)
* [Flame](http://www.kaspersky.com/flame)
* [Duqu](https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/)


## The Defenses 

### Anti-Malware Software

This is a baseline requirement for any networked personal computer.

* [Avast](https://www.avast.com)

* [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/) (grab the free download; the premium version adds real-time protection)


### Updated Software

OS X users: please upgrade to OS X El Capitan if you have not already to 
enjoy the benefits of [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899).

* [Enable automatic OS X updates](http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-mac-os-x-auto-updates/)
* [Enable auotmatic Windows updates](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-automatic-updating-on-off#turn-automatic-updating-on-off=windows-8)


### Multi-Factor Authentication 

Until [the password dies](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-mat-honan-password-hacker/), [multi-factor authentication](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-and-how-will-it-change-in-the-future/) is a must.

* [Why passwords have never been weaker—and crackers have never been stronger](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/)

* [Authy demo video](https://vimeo.com/71272779)

* [What is Yubikey?](https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-individuals/)

* [Using a security key on Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?hl=en)

* [Using a security key on Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2015/08/u2f-security-keys/)


### Password Managers

* [The secret to online safety: Lies, random characters, and a password manager](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/the-secret-to-online-safety-lies-random-characters-and-a-password-manager/)

* [What amateurs can learn from security pros about staying safe online](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/what-amateurs-can-learn-from-security-pros-about-staying-safe-online/)

* [1Password](https://1password.com) (paid, but the best one around)

* [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) (free for the platform you start on)

* [KeePass](http://keepass.info) (free and open-source)


### Back-up Everything

Without a back-up, you have no recourse if: 

* It [suddenly stops working](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/how-to-tell-when-your-hard-drive-is-going-to-fail.html)
* You spill water/coffee on your computer 
* Someone steals your computer

So let's back-up *all the data*!

* [$50 external hard drive](http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Basics-Portable-HDTB305XK3AA/dp/B00N2S73UC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460674990&sr=8-1&keywords=500+GB+portable&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011) (non-affiliate link)

* [Time Machine tutorial](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250)

* [Windows backup tutorial](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-back-up-your-files)


### Anti-Surveillance Tools

Worried about the NSA? Don't worry, they know.

* [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org)

* [Signal](https://whispersystems.org) (free mobile app for encrypted messaging and calls)

* [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/) now includes end-to-end encryption as well

* [Tor browser bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en)

* [FileVault tutorial](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)

* [BitLocker tutorial](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html)


### Secure Browser Configuration

* [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org)
* [WOT](https://www.mywot.com)
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE)

Note: the fewer extensions you have, the less of an attack surface 
exposed by your web browser.


### Secure Server Configuration

* [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/) for developers is a wonderful
  set of interactive tutorials that explain common application vulnerabilities
  like session hijacking, SQL injection, clickjacking, cross-site scripting
  (XSS), and more. It's totally free and should be part of any developer's 
  education.

* [7 Security Measures to Protect Your
  Servers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/7-security-
  measures-to-protect-your-servers) is a great place to start for learning how
  to lock down your Linux boxes (as they're often called)


### Secure Router Configuration

* [Know Your Network: The Complete Guide](http://lifehacker.com/5833254/know-your-network-the-complete-guide) is *the* guide you've been waiting for 
learning how to set-up and configure your person router. 

* If you don't trust consumer-grade routers and would rather build your
  own from scratch, Ars Technica has you covered with this 
  [step-by-step guide](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/numbers-dont-lie-its-time-to-build-your-own-router/).
